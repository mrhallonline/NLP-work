One pa- \\nper nt le& on general science was on the program for each bf \\nthese sessions and many other * subjects sidetracked into -general \\nscience. The prominence of this subject in appearing on these \\ndifferent programs is significant and yet gives little idea of’the \\nkeen inkrest given to it. In the last three sessions, nine-tenths \\nof the di’scussion provoked izs on the subject of general science. \\nGeneral science was tlie one live issue which interested all teachers \\nalike. \\non the bearing of general scicnw on- later courses in physics and \\nchemistry. The gencral feeling was that the general science should \\n‘ be’ taught,,not to’ prepatc sfor soqc future course,, but40 develop! \\nand educate the pupil according to his capacity. \\nAt thaecting of biulogx tcachcrs. the biology. cornpittee ’re- \\nported through Mr. Eddy of tlie Ncw Ybrk HTgh School of Com- \\nmerce, their plan for a‘tmo Scars coiirse of required science. This \\nwasadvocated to replace the one year of general science so yidely \\nadoptbid. - This report was- vigorouily assailed by a number of \\nspeakers, the chief objection to it bcing that it did not remove the \\n“vertical stratification” into special scicnccs whichmust be done \\nto make science general. \\nAt. the find science session, Prof, Dewey gave us a masterpiece \\non %ethod in Science Teaching”, in which general -science was \\nthe main theme. . ht+winsm for gcncral science passed all bounds \\nat this session until prof.

The \\nGeneral Science Quarterly has \\nnot printed editorials for some \\ntime. Bemuse we are only \\ntemporarily editing this mag- \\nazine, we have thought that \\nperhaps we ought not to depart \\nfrom custom. However, hav- \\ning a few comments to make \\nwe thought we would print \\nthem editorially in this issue. \\nas it will very likely be our \\nlast chance. It is expeded \\nthat Professor Whitman will \\nreturn from China, where he \\nis now teaching, next fall. + -- \\nIn speaking of Professor \\nWhitman, it reminds us that \\nhe has been kind enough to \\nwrite an article for us on the \\nscience education situation in \\nChina, which is printed in this \\nissue. d- \\nWe often have requests for \\nscience plays, yet we seldom \\nhave one sent to us for publi- \\ncation. If you have worked \\nout any sort of dramatization \\nin connection with your gen- \\neral science teaching, will you \\nnot send us an account of it, \\nso that we may make your \\nexperience of benefit to other \\nteachers. In an address by Professor \\nMillikan, printed in ‘T3chool \\nand Society,” November 21, \\n1925, and in “School Science \\nand Mathematics,” December, \\n1925, he makes some state- \\nments that would make many \\nscience teachers wish to sit \\ndown immediately and pen a \\nreply. Professor Eliot Down- \\ning has so ably done this in \\nthe January 16, 1926, issue of \\n“School and Society,” that we \\ncall attention to it rather than \\nattempt a reply of our own, \\nwhich could not be nearly as \\ngood. \\no-- - \\nOne of the most effective \\nmeans of contact between \\nscience and the pupil’s interest \\nis through the historical meth- \\nod of approach. We have evi- \\ndences of this through the \\nmethod of presentation of \\nsome of the science units as \\ngiven in the newer texts; €or \\nesample, the evolution of the \\nmethods of getting water, \\nfrom the old spring house, \\nthrough well sweeps, pulleys \\nand windlasses, to the pump; \\nor the evolution of communi- \\ncation from the beginnings of \\nspeech through the invention \\nof the alphabet, smoke signals, \\nheliograph, telegraph, tele- \\nphone aiid radio.

Readers will find in \\nthe present and forthcoming numbers one or more articles \\nrelating to each of the several major fields of science educa- \\ntion. The fields to be represented are: (1) Nature Educa- \\ntion and Elementary Science, (2) Junior High School Sci- \\nence or “General Science,” (3) Senior High School Biology, \\n(4) Senior High School Physics, (5) Senior High School \\nChemistry, (6) Training of Science Teachers, (7) Super- \\nvision of Science Instruction, and (8) Research in Science \\nEducation. Beginning with the January issue the book review \\nsection will be enlarged and there will appear an abstract sec- \\ntion in which will be found abstracts of articles appearing: in \\nother educational periodicals as well as abstracts of investiga- \\ntions completed in various sections of the country. \\nTo carry forward this enlarged plan, the editorial board has \\nbeen increased by the selection of a number of associate edi- \\ntors, divided into three groups: editors of articles, editors of \\nbook reviews, and editors of abstracts. The list of associate \\neditors is practically complete at the present time and includes \\nthe names of outstanding leaders in the field of science edu- \\ncation. We are pleased to announce the names of those who \\nhave enthiisiastically responded to our request and have offered \\ntheir services for the improvement of the journal. \\n295 296 SCIESCE EDUCATION \\nASSOCIATE EDITORS \\nR’atnre Study and Elementary Science : \\nArticles-31.

To this end \\nthere will appear in Science Education (1) articles and reports dealing \\nwith science and with the philosophy and practice of science teaching in \\nAmerican and foreign schools and colleges, (2) abstracts of articles reIated \\nto science and science education found in current periodicals, (3) abstracts \\nand reviews of recent books and monographs in the fields of science and \\nscience teaching, and (4) news and announcements concerning the activities \\nof individuals and organizations working for the improvement of science \\ninstruction. \\nReaders of the journal are invited to submit articles for publication. 2 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 16 No. 1 \\nThe editor will welcome articles on the philosophy of science teaching, \\ncurriculum construction, classroom procedures, investigations in the teach- \\ning of science, supervisory and administrative techniques or practices, and \\n“extra-curricular activities” associated with science instruction. Articles on \\npure and applied science of interest to science teachers will also be con- \\nsidered for publication. \\nThe Editor particularly invites readers to submit comments and criticisms \\non articles appearing in the journal. It is hoped that the journal may be \\nan open forum for the discussion of the various problems of science teach- \\ning. If the number and nature of comments warrant it, there will be estab- \\nlished, in addition to the present sections of the journal, a section devoted \\nto discussion and comments, \\nScience Reference Materials for Pupils and Teachers \\nIn this issue of the journal the Associate Editor in Charge of Abstracts \\nand New Publications presents a carefully selected list of science references \\nfor pupils. The December issue will contain a similar list for science teach- \\ners. These two lists will form an excellent nucleus for choosing new and \\nauthoritative books in the field of science. It is planned to supplement these \\nlists at regular intervals in later issues of the journal. \\nBibliography of Research Studies in Science Education \\nThe number of research studies relating to the teaching of science has \\ngrown very rapidly during the last ten years. The reports of these studies \\nappear in so many widely scattered sources that it seems advisable to \\nprovide in this journal a fairly complete bibliography of the many published \\ninvestigations. \\nThe Editor has prepared a card index of such investigations for use in \\nhis course entitled “Investigations in the Teaching of Science.” The first \\nsection of the bibliography appears in this issue. It is planned to complete \\nthe bibliography in the four issues of Volume 16. It is further planned \\nto provide in later issues a bibliography of unpublished theses relating to \\nscience education and to issue annual supplements to both the published \\nand unpublished investigations. \\n 1098237x, 1931, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160102 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

It was further decided to select one of the members of the \\nNational Council to act as representative on the Editorial Board of the \\njournal, should the request be granted, \\nIt is a pleasure to announce to the readers of the journal and especially \\nto those who are interested in science at the elementary-school level that \\nDr. Lois Meier Shoemaker of the New Jersey State Teachers ,College at \\nTrenton will be the representative of the National Council on the Editorial \\nBoard of the journal. The Editorial Board welcomes Dr. Shoemaker as a \\nnew member of the group. Dr. Shoemaker’s interest in the field of elementary \\nscience and her extensive studies of practices in this field, both in this country \\nand in foreign countries, admirably qualifies her to act in this capacity. \\nMembers of the National Council should send articles, news and announce- \\nments, and any other materials for publication in the journal to Dr. Shoe- \\nmaker. \\nProgress in the Teaching of Science \\nAs our sphere of knowledge in any field increases in size the number of \\npoints of contact with the sphere, that is, the number of unsolved problems, \\n263 264 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 16 No. 4 \\ngrows larger. Each idea suggests new ideas; activity leads to activity. To the \\nextent that the new idea, or the composite sphere of new ideas, is brought to \\nthe consideration of many minds-to that extent it is likely to be tested, \\nconfirmed, modified, or rejected. It is the spirit of science to set up hypotheses \\nand to subject these to the test of reflective thinking and scientific experi- \\nmentation. And it is one aspect of scientific attitude to hold that man’s con- \\nception of truth changes to the degree that ideas are subjected to criticism \\nand weighed in the balance of truth by scientific procedures. \\nIn this issue of the journal there appears a Symposium on the recently \\npublished Thirty-First Yeaybook, Part I, of the National Society for the \\nStudy of Education, entitled “A Program for Teaching Science.” The Year- \\nbook represents the present ideas of a group of men interested in promoting \\nthe better teaching of science in our public schools. In the opinion of the \\nwriter, the composite of the ideas expressed in the Yearbook has been pub- \\nlished as a hypothesis-as a tentative conclusion concerning the practice of \\nthe teaching of science. This hypothesis may be correct; it will likely be \\nmodified in the future; it may be rejected. At all events it should be sub- \\njected to the scrutiny of scientific thinking. It is representative of the views \\nof a certain group of individuals. The Symposium on the other hand repre- \\nsents a series of comments on the hypothesis set forth by those who pre- \\npared the Yearbook. These comments are based upon the experiences of the \\nwriters. As each individual reads the Yearbook and the Symposium, he, if \\nopen minded, is likely to emerge from the experience with a conclusion con- \\ncerning the teaching of science, which is in some ways in agreement with \\nand in other respects at variance with the points of view expressed by the \\nauthors. This type of emergence is a promising and mentally healthful \\nsymptom of the future progress in the teaching of science. \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION finds its proper place as an educational periodical \\nto the degree that it can include in its pages a variety of tested points of \\nview on matters relating to science teaching and to the extent to which the \\nexpressed points of view are representative of the entire group for which the \\njournal was established. It is with the latter point in mind that the editor \\nwishes to urge every reader to avail himself of the right to be represented in \\nthe field of science education by publishing his thought in the pages of \\nWe plan to publish a second symposium if the readers of the journal will \\ncontribute an expression of their views whether they are in accord or at \\nvariance with the views contained in the Yearbook and in the present \\nSymposium.

They \\nrepresent one means of keeping us in touch with men and deeds in this age \\nof ever-increasing activity, and to this end are valuable. A recent volume, \\nentitled Biographical Directory of Leaders in Education. and edited by J. \\nMcKeen Cattell, is described in the quotations below which are taken from \\na press notice sent by the editor. \\nThe BiographicaE Directory of Leaders in Education will take a place among \\nthe most important works of reference. Material for the book has been in course \\nof collection for a number of years along the lines of the Biographical Directory of \\nAmerican Men of Science, which in successive editions has been a standard work \\nfor twenty-five years. The two directories are under the same editorship, as are \\nalso Science and School and Society, weekly journals, the former of which since \\n1895, the latter since 1915, have maintained the highest position in the fields of \\nscience and of education. \\nThe Biographical Directory of Leaders in Education will contain biographies \\nof about 11,000 of those in America who have done the most to advance education, \\nwhether by teaching, writing, research or administration, a careful selection from \\nthe million educational workers of the United States and Canada. They are those \\nto whom daily reference is made in the press, from whom all positions of im- \\nportance are filled. It will be a work essential to all who have relations with those \\nengaged in educational work, necessary to every reference library. \\nLeaders in Education, like School and Society, aims to bring unity and com- \\nmon interest into educational work, covering the field from the nursery school and \\nbefore to the university and after, including libraries, museums and social agencies \\nas important factors in education. Like American Men of Science it is more than \\na compilation; it is a contribution to the advancement of education. \\nNot only on the editorial side but also in mechanical production, the book \\nwill maintain the standards of American Men of Science, being well printed and \\nwell bound, a book satisfactory for any student or any library to own, to show, \\nand to use. \\nThis volume is published by The Science Press, Grand Central Termi- \\nnal, New York City, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. \\n 1098237x, 1932, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160402 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

More \\nthan 2,000 promising titles have been carefully considered. Two preliminary mimeo- \\ngraphed lists of selected titles for each list were sent to specialists in various sec- \\ntions of the country for votes and comments, and the resulting titles are, it is felt, \\nthoroughly worthy of recommending to the public. \\nThe intention of this Committee was to publish a series of attractive lists of \\nworthwhile books, which are neither too ephemeral in their attempt to be popular, \\nnor too heavy to appeal to the “out-of-classroom” student of each of these sub- \\njects. \\nThe funds for printing these lists have been provided by the Carnegie Corporation \\nof New York. \\nThey are to be distributed free, within certain limitations, through public libraries \\nto their communities at large, through college libraries to members of the classes in \\nvarious science subjects, and through museums to their thousands of visitors, many of \\nwhom become interested in worthwhile study. Public libraries by cooperating with \\nhigh school libraries, will be able to place these lists in the hands of many upper- \\nclass students who follow scientific hobbies outside of school hours. \\nKindly examine these lists with care, and let us know, on the enclosed schedules, \\nhow many copies of each list you can distribute to advantage; by “advantage,” we mean \\ngetting them into the hands of promising individuals who will, so far as one can \\npredict, be likely to do some worthwhile reading. It is hoped that there will be no \\nwaste in the distribution; it is not the intention that they should be allowed to ac- \\ncumulate at library loan desks, in the offices of faculty members, or in the storerooms \\nof various institutions. It is assumed that the gift of a reasonable number of copies \\nof these lists will carry with it the obligation to have them distributed with discrimina- \\ntion, within the next three or four months. \\nIn returning the enclosed schedule of requests the Committee will expect to find \\nthat some lists are asked in greater number than others, according to the probable \\ndemand in each community. The edition of the various lists will be based on these re- \\nturns, and the total number of copies given to any public library will depend on \\nthe population of the community, in the case of college libraries, on the number of \\nstudents in the college, and in the case of museums, on the annual number of visitors. \\nPlease note that beyond this first free distribution of copies, the Committee will \\nbe able to supply additional copies of each list only on the payment of cost, which \\nwill be at the rate of one cent per list in any quantity, and in any assortment. This \\nis a special price made to libraries and institutions. As is stated on nearly all the lists, \\nindividuals who wish to secure complete sets of the lists can do so personally by send- \\ning 30 cents in stamps direct to the Association office at Washington. \\n 1098237x, 1932, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160302 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Each chapter has been prepared by a specialist in his field. \\nIt would appear from an examination of the summaries and bibliog- \\nraphies in the various subjects that the authors hold quite divergent views \\non what constitutes a research study in the psychology of a school subject. \\nAs stated in the preface, “From a broad point of view studies in the ob- \\njectives of the curriculum, studies in method, or studies in methods of test- \\ning may be considered as psychological in nature.” Several authors have \\nundoubtedly taken this broad point of view. Others have limited the sum- \\n 1098237x, 1932, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160302 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The content of the \\nissue is, therefore, another illustration of the fact that the title of a mono- \\ngraph does not always indicate the nature of the content. \\nOur readers will be interested in the summary of studies presented in the \\nchapter on “Science Education” by S. Ralph Powers and in the bibliog- \\nraphy which accompanies this chapter. From our point of view, it is dis- \\nappointing to believe that the small space given to this subject did not make \\nit possible to present a more searching analysis of the methods and results \\nof studies relating to the psychology of science teaching. \\nAs one reads this summary and scans the titles of studies in the bibliog- \\nraphy it is apparent that relatively few studies in the field of science edu- \\ncation have extended research to the more fundamental questions concern- \\ning the nature of science and concerning the elements and processes of \\nlearning in this subject. There is, for those trained in psychology and in the \\nfundamental sciences, an appealing and almost unlimited field for further \\nresearch at these deeper and more basic levels. This kind of research, more- \\nover, is essential to a valid interpretation and evaluation of the results of \\nthe more superficial studies relating to objectives, teaching techniques, and \\nmeasurement of results in science teaching. \\n 1098237x, 1932, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160302 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

With this thought in mind, the Editorial Board has in- \\nvited several leaders from the field of science education in foreign coun- \\ntries to join the staff of editors of Science Education. We are greatly \\npleased to introduce to our readers three men, scientists and teachers, \\nwho have accepted our invitation to become foreign editors and who have \\nexpressed their willingness to submit occasional notes and articles charac- \\nterizing interesting advances in science education in their respective \\ncountries. \\nDr. Otakar Matouiek, Professor of Earth Science in Education, \\nCharles University, Prague, Czechoslovakia, is an active leader in for- \\nmulating and developing science education in his country. Dr. MatouSek \\nrecently spent one year in America making a study of our educational \\nsystem and is at present connected with the Open-Air School of Geogra- \\nphy and Science in Education of Charles University. His special science \\nfield is geology. \\nMr. F. W.

Mr. Turner has had a brilliant academic \\ncareer in the fields of chemistry and education at the University of Lon- \\ndon having received various research fellowships. His last fellowship \\nbrought him to America where he made the teaching of general science \\nthe subject of his research. \\n353 354 SCIENCE EDUCATION [Vol. 16 No. 5 \\nDr. Karl von Hollander, Professor an der Padagogischen Akademie, \\nHalle, Germany, will represent his country on our staff. Dr. von Hollander \\nis one of the outstanding men in the field of science education in Germany \\nand has been a leader in the reorganization of science education in teacher- \\ntraining institutions. Biology is his subject-matter field. \\nSuggestions for Projects in a Local Activities Program \\nIn the April issue of Science Education, Dr. Edward E. Wildman, Di- \\nrector of Science Education, Philadelphia, and Chairman of the William \\nPenn Planning Committee, gave a brief description of plans for living \\nmemorials to William Penn. The School Committee on Penn Memorials \\nhas recently published its report in two pamphlets entitled William Penn \\nand the Delaware Zndians and On the National History of William Penn’s \\nDelaware Valley and Ours. These pamphlets, particularly the second which \\nis Part I1 of the Committee’s report, will be of especial interest to teachers \\nof elementary science. \\nThe general purpose and plan of the Committee’s work appears to be \\nladen with suggestions for teachers and administrators of science courses \\nin other communities that we quote from the preface of the report: \\nAt its meeting of organization held at the Academy of Natural Sciences in April, \\nthe committee gave itself the name of THE SCHOOLS COMMITTEE ON PENN \\nMEMORIALS, and set up certain goals to work for as living memorials to Penn, in \\nwhich the boys and girls of our schools can participate. The following were chosen, \\nand have been studied by sub-committees during the year : \\n(a) A study of the Indians of the Valley in Penn’s day, and of our present na- \\ntional Indian policy. \\n(b) Locating trees which are survivors of “Penn’s Woods,” and securing seedlings \\nfrom these, and planting them as Penn Memorial Trees. \\n(c) A study of local natural history throughout the Valley,-plants, animals, \\nminerals and fossils. \\n(d) A study of present and proposed parks, wild life sanctuaries and Penn \\nMemorial hiking trails for nature study, these to be laid out along old Indian \\ntrails where possible. \\n(e) Illuminating by radio portraits of Penn in Christ Church College Common, \\nOxford, England, and here in Philadelphia on October 24, using as the initial \\nenergy the light of a star 250 light years away. This interesting and wholly \\nunique project is under the care of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. \\n 1098237x, 1932, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730160502 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Anibal who has been elected \\nto a position at Leland Stanford University. Fortunately, Mr. Anibal \\nhas consented to represent the journal on the Western coast and will \\ncontinue on the Board as Western Business Manager. Mr. Pruitt will \\nalso remain on the staff as Associate Editor in charge of Abstracts and \\nNew Publications. His election to the staff of the School of Education \\nof New York University and his residence in New York makes for a closer \\ncontact between the offices of editor, associate editors, and business \\nmanager and assures for our readers a better journal. \\nWe are also glad to announce that the Science Association of the \\nMiddle States has selected SCIENCE EDUCATION as its official organ \\nand has designated Mr. W. L. Eikenberry of the State Teachers \\nCollege at Trenton, New Jersey, as its representative on the Editorial \\nBoard. The Science Association of the Middle States is an organization \\nof forward-looking teachers and supervisors of science who are making \\nsignificant contributions to science education. It is believed that the \\naffiliation between the Association and the journal will bring to our \\nreaders many excellent papers presented at the meetings of the associa- \\ntion and that the journal will be of value to members of the Association. \\nt75 Editorials \\nand educational news \\nTHE TRAINING OF SCIENCE TEACHERS \\nA study of present state requirements \\nfor teaching certificates reveals that diver- \\nsity of practice is perhaps even greater \\nthan had been supposed. For example in \\nthe case of two adjoining New England \\nstates, the college graduate in one is re- \\nquired to have but two semester hours in \\neducation for a license to teach whereas \\nacross the line he must have at least twelve ! \\nAt the end of two years he must have eight \\nsemester hours in the first state, while in \\nthe second he must have twenty-four be- \\nfore he can obtain a professional certificate \\ngood for five years. With respect to prac- \\ntice teaching, the contrast between these \\nstates is even greater. The first state re- \\nquires nothing in the way of practice teach- \\ning while the second requires one semester \\nof full-time apprenticeship under a critic \\napproved by the state department before \\na professional teaching certificate is issued. \\nMoreover, no amount of experience in \\nteaching before application for a certifi- \\ncate is made in this state is accepted in lieu \\nof the requirement in practice teaching. It \\nis rather disturbing to find two states with \\nneeds for teachers undoubtedly very sim- \\nilar in such disagreement as to how those \\nneeds may best be provided for. \\nThe three main elements in the prospec- \\ntive teacher’s program are professional \\ncourses, practice teaching, and academic \\nspecialization. Variations exist in all three, \\nfrom situations in which practically nothing \\nis specified, and little or nothing required, \\nto some in which requirements seem to go \\ntoo far in the opposite direction. With such \\ngreat variations in requirements for a \\nteaching license the problem of training teachers for our secondary schools is not an \\neasy one. It is no less difficult for those \\nconcerned with the training of teachers of \\nscience than for those in other fields. \\nThe sad part of the whole matter is the \\neffect on the instruction and the pupils in \\nour secondary schools. In the end it is the \\npupil who suffers. He is taught biology by \\na teacher who never studied it, or chemistry \\nby one who hasn’t seen a high-school class- \\nroom or laboratory since his own high- \\nschool days, or general science by one who \\nholds concepts of education akin to those \\nof the schoolmasters of the Middle Ages. It \\nis indeed a reflection upon modern education \\nand modern educators that such inade- \\nquately trained persons and persons with \\nsuch widely varying types of training are \\npermitted to teach. There is a great need \\nfor careful studies of the qualities that make \\nfor success in science teaching, as well as in \\nother fields, and the building of teacher \\ntraining programs that will make sub- \\nstantial and measurable contributions to the \\ndevelopment of such qualities. There is \\nalso need for discussion and cooperative \\nappraisals of requirements for certification \\nin the various states so that a common basis \\nfor progress can be reached.

NOLL, \\nRhode Island State College \\nPRINCIPLES VERSUS FACTS \\nWhether we are willing to admit it or \\nnot, the fact remains that the objective \\n178 DEC., 19351 EDITORIALS AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS 1 79 \\nwhich dominates the teaching of science in \\nmost of our secondary schools today is the \\nimparting of mere factual information. \\nThis objective is a heritage from the past \\nwhen courses were more strictly technical \\nbecause they were frankly designed to pre- \\npare a more highly selected group for col- \\nlege. The emphasis upon learning and re- \\ntaining factual information, however, \\ndeserves the criticism that it encourages the \\niiiemoriter type of course with all its at- \\ntendant evils. It encourages and rewards \\nchiefly the pupil who possesses a facile \\nmemory. Success in the course is often \\nmeasured by the pupil’s immediate recall of \\nthe facts he has learned by assiduous cram- \\nming and has retained for the examination \\nperiod only. \\nThe fact-learning goal merits the further \\ncriticism that it encourages much unin- \\nspired and even incompetent teaching. \\nCommonly the teacher assigns for the fol- \\nlowing day “the next five pages,” or the \\n“next list of problems,” and devotes the \\nsubsequent class period to oral quizzing to \\nascertain the extent to which the pupils \\nhave “mastered” the facts included in the \\nlesson assigned. Furthermore, teachers \\nwith inadequate and occasionally with no \\ntraining in science, whatever, undertake to \\nteach science courses, relying upon their \\nintelligence and maturity to enable them \\nto “keep ahead of the class.” Once they \\nhave taught the course a few times and \\nhave by repetition mastered its factual con- \\ntent, they can thereafter teach it with maxi- \\nmum confidence and minimum effort. \\nBut thoughtful teachers of science have \\nalways worried because their pupils have \\nproved perversely and almost universally \\nunable to retain for more than a brief period \\nthe facts they were supposed to have \\nlearned. A number of careful investiga- \\ntions have shown conclusively that the goal \\nof mere fact learning is a futile one because \\nthe pupils never really achieve it. Consci- \\nentious teachers therefore ask in discour- \\nagement, “What shall we try to teach?” \\nAn answer is, “Shift your emphasis from teaching facts for their own sake to teach- \\ning facts as a means of giving the pupils an \\nunderstanding of principles. Make the \\nfacts serve not as an end in themselves but \\nas the means to a more important as well as \\na more practical end.” \\nThere has been much loose thinking and \\nwriting about principles ; probably nobody \\nwould be willing to state dogmatically what \\na principle is. A practical working defini- \\ntion, serviceable in most situations, how- \\never, is that a principle is a generalization \\nderived from facts. The greater the array \\nof facts which the statement generalizes, the \\nmore nearly the statement as a principle \\napproaches the dignity of a “major gener- \\nalization.” \\nThe learning of such facts as contribute to \\na comprehension of a scientific principle is \\nimportant. But once the principle has be- \\ncome established in the pupil’s mind, it is \\na matter of small consequence whether or \\nfor how long he retains an accurate knowl- \\nedge of the facts which served to bring to \\nhim a clear understanding of the principle. \\nFor example, the fact that a certain moth is \\ninvisible against the bark of a tree is likely \\nto be of importance only in helping the pupil \\nto comprehend the principle of protective \\ncoloration. The fact that the sun is ninety- \\nthree million miles from the earth has \\nserved its only significant purpose for the \\npupil when it has helped him to gain a con- \\nception of the principle (or major general- \\nization) “space is vast.” \\nEmphasis upon the teaching of scientific \\nprinciples, with its accompanying emanci- \\npation from fact-learning for the mere sake \\nof fact-learning, raises at once the whole \\nplane of science teaching and learning. \\nOnly the well-trained teacher who knows \\nhis field through an extensive study of it \\nis qualified to teach principles. Only such \\na teacher is able to focus his attention “upon \\nthe forest rather than upon the individual \\ntrees.” Furthermore, the pupil who has \\nhad his attention consistently directed be- \\nyond the minutia of detail to the broad gen- \\neralizations which the detailed facts estab- \\n 1098237x, 1935, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730190411 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

We wish again to extend \\nthis invitation to all readers to the end that \\nthe journal may become a fwugm for the \\nexpression of views relating to any signifi- \\ncant problem in the field of science educa- \\ntion and also a source of information con- \\ncerning events of interest to all science \\nteachers. \\nFormerly we have printed “Editorial \\nNotes and Comments” and “News and An- \\nnouncements” in separate sections. These \\ntwo sections are now combined into a single \\nsection. \\nIt is our plan to present in this new sec- \\nticm editoras, editorial comment on new \\ndevelopments bearing directly or indirectly \\non science teaching, programs and reports \\nof meetings of science teachers, and such \\nother educational news as seems worthy \\nand interesting. \\nWith a special section for these types of \\nmaterbl, the Editw believes that the jour- \\nnal may become more human in its values, \\nand more significant to administrators and \\nteachers of science at all school levels. We \\ncordially invite our readers to contribute \\nfor publication itenas of the nature sug- \\ngested herein. HOW MANY ORGANIZATIONS OF \\nSCIENCE TEACHEKS? \\nAlmost forty years ago twelve Chicago \\nteachers met one Saturday night to dine \\nand talk together. The menu was good, \\nthough I do not recall it, but the factotum \\nhad been told that science teachers should \\ndine as well as business men, The topic, \\ntrend and one immediate result of the eve- \\nning’s meeting is doubtless still well-re- \\nmembered by all living members of the \\ngroup. The topic was “HOW can the ser- \\nvice of science in education be improved?” \\nThe discussion developed the thought that \\nscience teaching needs more teachers who \\npossess good scholarship and good profes- \\nsional training. One immediate result of \\nthe meeting was a decision to have the \\nsame group meet for dinner discussions \\nonce a month. For three years eight meet- \\nings per year were held, the last yearly \\nmeeting being participated in by both wives \\nand husbands where such combinations ex- \\nisted. The topic each evening was opened \\nby one who prepared in advance. The dis- \\ncussions were factual, virile and imper- \\nsonal. No votes were ever taken. Indeed, \\nit was agreed at the first meeting that any \\nmember of the group might always use any \\nmaterial or ideas presented in the group, \\nbut that no one was under any obligation to \\nact in accord with others of the group. \\nThat is, the group existed for honest ex- \\nchange of ideas regarding a common cause, \\nrather than to gain agreement of a major- \\n128 Om., 19351 EDITORIALS AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS 129 \\nity for use in influencing or controlling \\nothers. The members of that group later \\nwent to various educational positions. \\nWhen rare occasions now permit any two \\nor three of the group to meet, the evident \\nunselfish respect and mutual confidence \\nprovide one of the enduring pleasures of \\nprofessional life. \\nThere are many other kinds of science \\norganizations. In cities of medium size \\nthere is often a general organization, in- \\ncluding all teachers of secondary science. \\nIn larger cities the organizations usually \\nrepresent special science subjects. State \\norganizations and those including several \\nstates are common. The tendency has been \\nfor the larger territory and larger popula- \\ntion groups to be organized about specific \\nscience subjects, the Science Section of the \\nN. E. A. being a notable exception to this \\ntendency. The National Association for \\nResearch in Science Teaching (N. A. R. \\nS. T.) is national in its scope and purposes, \\nbut restricted in membership to those defi- \\nnitely concerned with research regarding \\nscience teaching. The newly organized \\nAmerican Science Teachers’ Association \\n(A. S. T. A.) is national in scope (includ- \\ning Canada), and proposes to serve those \\ninterested in any aspect of the use of sci- \\nence in education. \\nThe N. A. R. S. T. has more than justi- \\nfied the hopes of its organizers, and like \\nmost worthy achievements, now seems to \\nhave visions surpassing those it had when \\nit started. The improvement of both qual- \\nity and quantity of exact studies about sci- \\nence teaching is its worthy goal. That is, \\nthe N. A. R. S. T. is working toward a sci- \\nentific study of the educational uses of \\nscience. Its magazine has assumed a lead- \\ning position in publication of research \\nstudies. Every ambitious and industrious \\nscience teachcr should be encouraged to \\nread this magazine regularly ; indeed, he \\ncan illy afford not to do so. Although the work of the N. A. R. S. T. and its maga- \\nzine represent a relatively small number of \\nworkers, the work itself is of large import \\nto all science teachers. \\nThe A. S. T. A. was organized in connec- \\ntion with the American Association for the \\nAdvancement of Science. It is open to \\nmembership by all teachers of science. \\nOther science organizations may send dele- \\ngates to the annual meetings, and individ- \\nuals may also be members. In no sense is \\nis restrictive. Meeting as it does with the \\nwinter meeting of the A. A. A. S., it pro- \\nvides occasion for science teachers to hear \\nresearch programs related to the science \\nsubjects of their special interest. Then, of \\ninterest to all are the considerations of sci- \\nence teaching topics of national signifi- \\ncance. The only authority of A. S. T. A. \\nregarding science education is like that of \\nthe larger American Association for the \\nAdvancement of Science, which is the au- \\nthority of good evidence. Votes even by \\nmajorities are sometimes absurdly unintel- \\nligent. . The truths of science are not es- \\ntablished by majority votes. The great ob- \\nligation is to distribute knowledge with \\nsuch supporting evidence as is available. \\n“But,” says a young science teacher, “I \\ncan afford to belong to only one science or- \\nganization. Which shall it be?” My an- \\nswer would be, “Unless you change your \\nattitude, it matters little which one you \\nchoose.” Local conditions and problems \\nsurely demand the teacher’s participation. \\nState and sectional problems also call for \\nparticipation. Research is always opening \\ndoors to new views for the science teacher. \\nAnd participation in discussions of national \\nproblems, as well as scholarly growth \\nthrough association with science leaders, \\nwould seem all but obligatory upon any \\nteacher who cares to be more than a teacher \\nof routine daily lessons about science. \\nOTIS W.

We are pleased to \\nwelcome this new periodical, believing that \\nit will fill a real need if the later issues \\nmaintain the excellence of the first two \\nnumbers in content, literary style, and \\ntypography. \\nThe general purposes of the journal are \\nstated in a paragraph of the March issue as \\nfollows : \\nTHE SCIENCE COUNSELOR hopes to help teach- \\ners by bringing to them authentic scientific in- \\nformation before it reaches textbook stage. It \\n~ will call attention to modern and successful \\nteaching techniques. It hopes to give its readers \\na progressive point of view; to inspire them to a \\ncareful and scientific study of their own prob- \\nlems ; to encourage them to analyze and improve \\nthe teaching methods they use every day. The \\nstaff of this magazine will be glad to help them \\nto cooperate in solving their common problems \\nand to assist them in evaluating and applying \\nthe results of researches. The combined efforts \\nand resources and influences of the teachers of \\nscience in the Catholic high schools can be both \\npowerful and productive. \\nRETIREMENT-ENLISTMENT \\nDr. Otis W. Caldwell, having passed the \\nage of retirement from Teachers College, \\nColumbia University, was voted the title of \\nProfessor Emeritus by the Board of Trus- \\ntees, effective June 30, 1935. On that date \\nhis directorship of the Institute of School \\nExperimentation ceased, though he con- \\ntinues in an advisory capacity on certain \\ninvestigations in which he and his staff \\nwere engaged. \\nOur readers will be pleased to know that \\nDr. Caldwell’s work as General Secretary \\nof the American Association for the Ad- \\nvancement of Science and other scientific \\nwork will be continued from his office in \\nthe Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, Inc., Yonkers, New York, where \\nprofessional communications may be sent \\nafter September 1, 1935. \\nIt is our earnest and cordial wish that he \\nmay serve through many more years, with \\nhis usual vigor and helpfulness, the fields \\nof science and science education. \\nNEW JERSEY STATE TEACHERS \\nCOLLEGES MEETING \\nThe annual institute of the Association \\nof New Jersey State Teachers Colleges and \\nNormal Schools was hcld at the State \\nTeachers College at Trenton on April 18, \\n1935, \\nAfter greetings by President Roscoe L. \\nWest, the general meeting was addressed \\nby Edgar F.

All insects have six \\njsinted legs is a generalized fact. One \\nmust pick out the essential features after \\nseeing all sorts of watches and generalize \\non the basis of them to arrive at the defini- \\ntion of the word watch. \\nIt is because we solve most of the prob- \\nlems of a scientific character with which we \\nare faced in life by the application of some \\nknown principle or principles of science \\nthat the mastery of the most needed of \\nthese is so important in school instruction. \\nThe problems may be those concerning \\nwhich we must do something or those we \\nsolve just to satisfy our intellectual curi- \\nosity. \\nA principle or law is not mastered when \\nthe pupil is able to state it correctly in \\nwords. That may be a parrot-like per- \\nformance. The test of mastery is the abil- \\nity to select and use the principle needed \\nto solve a problem of the sort that arises in \\nlife. E. E. Bayles in his article on the “Limitations of the Morrison Unit,” pre- \\nsented in the December, 1934, issue of this \\njournal, says of the eighteen-months-old \\nbaby playing in his bath “he expects the \\nhollow celluloid duck to remain on top of \\nthe water . . . and . . . the bar of castille \\nsoap to go to the bottom.” Then he asks \\n“does he not know anything of the flotation \\nprinciple? Has he no mastery of it?” I \\nshould say not in the least. But he is get- \\nting experiences that will help to clarify \\nsome of the terms in which it may bd \\nstated. He similarly asks of the six- or \\nseven-year-old child whom we may get to \\ntell us that heavy things will sink and light \\nthings will float, “does he not have an un- \\nderstanding of the principle of flotation.” \\nAgain I say “No.” He does begin to see \\nthat flotation is a matter of relative ;weight \\nbut he does not have any idea as yet as to \\nwith what the object that is to sink or float \\nmust be compared in weight. Nor do I \\nthink that the student in the physics class \\nwould be entirely at a loss for an answer \\nwhen asked a question as to how high a \\nballoon of a given density will ascend in \\nthe atmosphere. He would reply that it \\nwould ascend to a point at which the den- \\nsity of the atmosphere equals that of the \\nballoon. He can not answer in terms of \\nfeet and inches, nor could anyone without \\nmore data and the mastery of more prin- \\nciples than that of flotation. This student \\nI take it has arrived at the point of mas- \\ntery though I should be more certain if I \\nmight give him a few more problems to \\nsolve. I agree with Bayles that much in- struction must precede mastery. Many \\nterms must be clarified, many subordinate \\nunderstandings achieved. But to me the \\npoint of mastery seems as definite as the \\nboiling point. \\nLet the teacher who is about to help \\npupils master a principle make a list of the \\nterms to be clarified, of the subordinate \\nideas to be acquired and of the teaching \\ndevices to ,be used to accomplish these sev- \\neral items. It will add to the zest of teach- \\ning if the instructor will experiment with \\nseveral classes to see what experiment will \\nput an idea over to pupils most success- \\nfully. Suppose I drop the twenty-gram \\nscale weight into a beaker of water. Then \\ntake it out and dry it off and drop it into a \\nbeaker of mercury. In the first instance it \\nsinks, in the second it floats. Would that \\nhelp a pupil at the learning stage of \\nBayles’ seven-year-old see what he needed \\nto know? Or would some other experience \\nserve better? Let the instructor keep \\nnotes on such questions as arise in his work \\nand of his attempts to answer them expen- \\nmentally and he will build up in time an ex- \\nperimential background that will make his \\ninstruction effective and his job increas- \\ningly interesting. \\nELLIOT R.

This \\nbulletin and the other bulletins which com- \\nprise the directory are briefly described in \\nthe following release from the Office of \\nEducation. \\nPublished in record time this year, the five- \\ncent bulletin lists names and addresses of more \\nthan 1,000 State school officers and approxi- \\nmately 3,500 county and township public school \\nadministrators in the several states. \\nThe U. S. Educational Directory, compiled \\neach year by the Federal Office of Education, is \\nused widely by business houses and agencies \\ndealing with schools and school people. It \\nserves as a useful reference guide in school and \\nother libraries. The Directory is always much \\nin demand, being the most complete guide to \\nAmerica’s public school officers published \\nthroughout the country. \\nThe four parts making up this year’s complete \\n1936 Educational Directory, which are available \\nfrom the Superintendent of Documents, Govern- \\nment Printing Office, Washington, D.

Parker, pre- \\nsiding. The papers were presented according to \\nthe program published in the February issue of \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION. \\nLuncheon was served in the Adam Room at \\nnoon. The guest speaker, Mr. Henry M. Ken- \\nnon, Curator of Birds, St. Louis Zoological \\nPark, gave a very instructive presentation of \\nsome of the most peculiar activities of birds all \\nover the world. \\nThe afternoon session was given to a sym- \\nposium on the progress in the teaching of ele- ences in observing science classes in various \\nstates and on the trends in curriculum construc- \\ntion, in methods and procedures, and in teacher \\ntraining in the field of elementary science. Ira \\nC. Davis, University of Wisconsin, told of the \\nwork in the elementary science that is being \\ncarried on in the state of Wisconsin, how the \\nteachers are made to feel that they have a real \\npart in this work, and of the philosophy under- \\nlying the work. Harry A. Carpenter, Rochester, \\nNew York, indicated the progress that is being \\nmade at preseilt in Rochester in teaching ele- \\nmentary science by radio. Miss Jennie Hall, \\nMinneapolis, next presented an enlightening ac- \\ncount of the progress in teaching elementary \\nscience in Minneapolis during the last twelve \\nyears. The next presentation was an account of \\nprogress in Iowa looking to the establishment of \\nelementary science in the schools and was given \\nby Miss Lillian Hethershaw, Drake University. \\nMiss Allegra J. Ingleright, of South Bend, In- \\ndiana, told of the curriculum reconstruction in \\nelementary science now going on at South Bend. \\nMiss Mary Melrose, Cleveland, offered sugges- \\ntions for formulating a course of study in sci- \\nence and also indicated that the radio may be \\nused to multiply the work of a few good teach- \\ners. The final discussion was presented by \\nMiss Geraldine Shontz, State Teachers College, \\nTerre Haute, Indiana, who described the elab- \\noration of a unit on dogs at the fifth-grade \\nlevel. \\nThe annual business meeting was next called \\nto order. The minutes of the previous meeting \\nwere read and approved.

Today he looks upon a dif- \\nferent world from that of his boyhood. \\nDifferent in methods of lighting, heating, \\nsanitation, and building construction ; dif- \\nferent in methods of transportation and \\ncommunication ; completely changed in its \\nhowledges concerning diatetics and nutri- \\ntion, the uses of vitamins and hormones, \\nthe causal agents of disease and our meth- \\nods of fighting them. And these contrasts \\nhave been brought about through the appli- \\ncations of science in human affairs. \\nTo keep pace with these changes and \\nsuccessfully to make them meaningful to \\nour pupils, our philosophy of science teach- \\ning must be pragmatic. We are not SO \\nmuch concerned with theories or even the \\n“big ideas” of science as we are in their \\npractical applications in the lives of those \\nwe teach, As one of the editors of this \\nJournal has recently said, “The human or- \\nganism is in constant interaction with his \\nenvironment, both as an individual and as \\na member of the social group.” If he is to \\nmake the necessary adjustments for sane \\nand healthy living, he must integrate his sci- \\nence experiences with those of his work- \\naday world so that he may intelligently in- \\nterpret such experiences and solve the \\nproblems that he meets in the environment \\nin which he is placed. The solving of problems has been man’s \\nlot ever since he first appeared on the \\nearth. He has muddled along through un- \\nnumbered centuries and today, in spite of \\nthe changed world in which he lives, he \\nstill commonly ignores the fundamentals of \\nthe scientist’s methods of attacking such \\nproblems. It would therefore seem that one \\nof the chief values of science in the modem \\ncurriculum would be an exposure of young \\npeople to the method of science. The be- \\nginner in science ought constantly to be \\nhabituated in the use of the inductive and \\ndeductive methods in problem solving. The \\nproblems presented need not be difficult, \\ntechnical, or abstract. On the contrary, \\nthey should be concrete and related to the \\nlife experiences of the learner. But they \\nshould be used on every possible occasion \\nso as to habituate the student in a way of \\nlooking at his life problems. Motivation of \\nthe truest kind comes through the discov- \\nery of problems that the child adopts as his \\nown. The richest implications of Gestalt \\npsychology lie in this problematic approach, \\nfor the child needs to see where he is going \\nin order to amve at the goal. The wise \\nteacher will use such techniques as will best \\naid in .attaining this end. The Morrisonian \\nidea of the preview in unitary development \\nis sound psychology because it presents the \\ngoal at the most opportune time. The re- \\ncent trend toward the early presentation of \\n“big ideas” and generalization is also sound \\nbecause it uses the same psychological ap DEC., 19361 EDITORIALS AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS 22 1 \\nproach. But here the weakness lies in the \\nfact that young children, because of their \\nimmaturity, may memorize generalizations \\nthat are meaningless to them. If education \\nis to be a continuous process, then general- \\nizations must grow out of experiences. \\nAgain our pragmatic philosophy demands \\nthat we adopt such of these educational \\npractices as we find by experiment will \\nwork, remembering constantly that we are \\ndealing with individual differences and not \\nwith classroom groups. \\nAs a corollary of what has just been said, \\nit is evident that if science teaching is to \\nbear fruit in the attitudes, activities, and \\nknowledges of most worth to the learner, \\nthen such activities and knowledges must be \\nintegrated in the curriculum so that society \\nas well as the individual may gain through \\nsuch experiences. To become a thinking \\ncitizen, one needs the attitudes and knowl- \\nedges that science can best give when inte- \\ngrated with civics and history. Consumer \\nneeds can best be met through science inte- \\ngration with commercial subjects, home \\neconomics, and the social studies. The \\nhealth goal certainly cannot be attained \\nwithout integration with biological science. \\nThe old-time formalized subject matter is \\ndisappearing (as can be seen in restrospect \\nof forty years of active teaching) and in its \\nplace a socialized curriculum is arising. In \\nthis curriculum, science will play a most \\nimportant part, because it will best help the \\nlearner to live healthfully and successfully \\nin his environment. \\nFinally, my philosophy of teaching has \\nalways been Herbartian. Children have \\ndefinite interests, just as do adults. The \\ntestimony o€ adults may not always be re- \\nliable, but it is admitted as evidence in \\ncourt trials. The testimony of children \\nmay not always be reliable, and their inter- \\nests naturally are effervescent, but by build- \\ning on the child’s natural interests, we may \\nlead him to the acceptance of truths which \\nare fundamental. There is so much of in- terest in the world of science that our \\nscience classrooms ought to be filled with \\nyoungsters who work for the joy of work- \\ning, and instead of decreasing enrollment, \\nscience shouId be accepted as one of the \\nmost important of the core subjects in an \\nintegrated curriculum. When this day \\ncomes, we need not fear for the future of \\nscience teaching in this country. \\nGEORGE W. HUNTER, \\nClaremont Colleges, \\nClaremont, California \\nINTERPRETATIVE GENERALIZATIONS \\nAS AIDS IN CURRICULUM WORK \\nIN SCIENCE \\nThere are striking contrasts between \\neducational theory of a generation ago and \\nof today. The older theory stressed the \\ndevelopment of the powers of the individ- \\nual. Emphasis in teaching was on physical, \\nintellectual, and moral training. This em- \\nphasis was supported by conceptions of \\nmental discipline and by the demands for \\npreparation for the responsibilities of adult- \\nhood and for further education. Educa- \\ntional theory of today is influenced by con- \\nsideration of social needs. It is in effect \\nan expression of a social philosophy. Em- \\nphasis in teaching is on understandings \\nwhich will guide action, on the social COP- \\nsequences of action, and on ideals and at- \\ntitudes, ways of thinking, and conceptions \\nof value which will aid in the evaluation \\nof consequences The effects of this newer \\ntheory may be seen in recent reports on \\nscience teaching. \\nThe report of the Science Committee of \\nthe National Society for the Study of Edu- \\ncation (the Thirty-first Yearbook) is one of \\nthe pioneer efforts to adopt science teaching \\nto a social philosophy of education. This \\nCommittee recognized the influence of \\nscientific achievements on our society and \\non the activities that go on in it. The re- \\nport is an effort to give guidance in educa- \\ntional planning which will result in a greater \\nuse of intelligence in these activities.

The report outlines a plan for a \\nprogram for teaching science, continuous \\nthrough the elementary and secondary \\nschool and articulated with the college, de- \\nsigned to relate achievements in understand- \\nings in science to the influences, actual and \\npotential, of these achievements on individ- \\nual and social life. \\nA significant feature in this report is the \\nrecommendation favoring the use of broad \\ngeneralizations as agencies for relating un- \\nderstandings of scientific achievements to \\nhuman experiences. These generalizations, \\nwhich in contrast with pure science general- \\nizations may be called interp.retative, are \\nused %.guides in the organization of sub- \\nject matter. The importance of this feature \\nin the recommendations is that it suggests \\na definable procedure for accomplishing a \\ncloser integration of school activities and \\nsocial activities. it is important to note that \\nother educators, working contemporane- \\nously with this science committee, particu- \\nlarly in the social studies and more recently \\nin mathematics and some other fields, have \\nfavored a similar use of interpretative gen- \\neralizations in the organization or’ subject \\nmatter. \\nThis recommendation has had wide ac- \\nceptance among curriculum workers in \\nscience. These interpretative generaliza- \\ntions are serving at least three related func- \\ntions. Probably the most obvious function \\nis that they associate ideas from different \\nareas of specialization thus bringing to- \\ngether, in meaningful relations, ideas from \\nmore or less discrete subjects. The second \\nfunction is that they relate the content of \\ninstruction to life. This second function \\nis really a consequence of the first. When \\nideas from different subjects are brought \\ntogether in meaningful relations the asso- \\nciations of ideas are necessarily more nearly in agreement with the associations that are \\nmade in thinking about life activities than \\nassociations which are Iimited by boundaries \\nof subjects. The ideas associated in inter- \\npretative generalizations tend to be, in fact, \\nthe ideas that are associated in thinking \\nabout life activities. Such generalizations \\nmust in the nature of things “ramify into \\nhuman affairs.” The third function is that \\nthey serve to guide in planning for con- \\ntinuity in science teaching at the same time \\nthey serve to guide in correlating science \\nwith other areas of instruction. Illustra- \\ntions of their use in curriculum making \\nmay be seen in courses of study of recent \\nissue for elementary and secondary schools \\nand for colleges. \\nIt must be clear that this procedure in \\ncurriculum making is of no significance for \\nitself. It is a means to an end. In this \\ninstance it is a means for using understand- \\nings that have come from scientific achieve- \\nment in accomplishinx the educational aims \\nsuggested by a social philosophy. The use \\nof interpretative generalizations for this \\npurpose requires that the curriculum maker \\nsee the relationships between subject matter \\nfrom different fields and it requires. that he \\nsee the relationships of his subject matter \\nto human activities. With recognition of \\nrelations to human activities he is able to \\nselect, from the broad areas, content which \\nwill contribute to greater use of intelligence \\nin these activities. Interpretative general- \\nizations are useful to curriculum workers \\nand to teachers for directing the course of \\neffort in a continuous program of..socially \\nsignificant science teaching. Obviously, \\nthey are not statements set down to be \\nlearned or mastered by students. In fact, \\nmastery .of an interpretative generalizatian \\nseems unthinkable. \\nA recommendation is useful if it stimu- \\nlates teachers and others to study critically \\nand to evaluate their own work, and if it \\nfurnishes guidance in relating their work \\nmore closely to acceptable educational aims \\nand functions. By these criteria the recom- \\n 1098237x, 1936, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730200410 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

What is it we want the pupils to \\nderive from their study of elementary \\nscience, general science, biology, physics, \\nor chemistry?” Facts innumerable may be \\nlisted, no one of which seems really essen- \\ntial. On the other hand, there are certain \\nprinciples or certain ideaxoncepts (call \\nthem generalizations if you will), which, \\nif possessed by the student, should enable \\nhim to understand and appreciate better \\nthose daily happenings he encounters from \\nthe time he awakens in the morning until \\nhe closes his eyes in sleep at night. What \\nshall we teach? \\nTo be sure, science teaching is one of the \\ntools used for “processing” pupils to fit \\nthem to take their places as useful mem- \\nbers of society, and to enable them to get \\nfor themselves a maximum enjoyment out \\nof living. Thus may science teaching con- \\ntribute both to the work-time and leisure- \\ntime needs of the child. If science teach- \\ning is to be an effective tool for this \\n“processing,” teachers must use methods \\nthat will conform to, or aid the learning \\nprocesses of the pupil. Science teaching \\nmust not be solely a “pouring in” and \\n“ramming down of measured doses of in- \\nformation.” It must provide for the de- \\nvelopment in the pupil of those attitudes \\nand abilities which society has found useful \\nin meeting and solving life’s problems. \\nHOW shall we teach? \\nA twelve-year program of science educa- \\ntion must provide for the development of \\nskill in the use of the method of science by \\nactual practice in using it throughout the \\nwhole elementary and secondary school period, if returns to the child are to com- \\npensate him fully for his time and energy. \\nOnly as science training developed through \\nthese years actually fits the child to apply \\nhis knowledge of science scientifically, so \\nas to understand and appreciate nature and \\nhimself, and to serve as a useful citizen \\nbecause of his abilities and his attitudes, can \\nscience expect to hold its place as a neces- \\nsary part in the general education of the \\nchild. What results do we expect from \\nour teaching? \\nThe above questions are answered by \\nimplication in the three paragraphs above, \\nand indicate to that extent my philosophy \\nof science teaching. The methods or “pro- \\ncessing” patterns that have been in use in \\nthe Rochester schools for nearly a decade \\ninvolve instructional units based upon prob- \\nlem-solving by the pupil. An instructional \\nunit provides not only for the acquisition \\nof facts and for training in the scientific \\nmethod of problem-solving, but for prac- \\ntice in using facts and principles secured \\nto solve problems met in everyday life. \\nThus the method becomes a tool for better \\nthinking and living. \\nEach instructional unit structurally con- \\ntains three or four sets of problems con- \\ntributing to the development of as many \\nsimple concepts. These concepts function \\nas building stones, or stepping stones, by \\nwhich the pupil is able, with guidance, to \\narrive at larger inclusive concepts or gen- \\neralizations. This is the learning objective \\nof theunit. \\nThe general concept of each unit is \\nselected as representing a desirable learn- \\ning product in the content area. This, in \\nturn, is analyzed into the contributing or \\nminor concepts. Problems are the result \\nof experiences with children. \\nNo claim is,made that the major con- \\ncepts are most desirable, or that they have \\nbeen most accurately analyzed into the \\nminor or contributing ideas.

In \\nthis way, individual pupil needs are met. \\nThe important thing is that we have here \\na pattern which, if carried out in its essen- \\ntial features by pupils under the direction \\nof the teacher, not only provides the pupil \\nwith an adequate supply of factual infor- \\nmation, but also provides for directed prac- \\ntice in problem solving and in making gen- \\neralizations. \\nMany \\ninvolve individual and group laboratory \\nexercises, both in the laboratory and out- \\nside of school. Some involve Iibrary refer- \\nence work in addition to the usual textbook \\nwork. Others are purely observational in \\ncharacter, being intended to direct the \\npupil’s attention to specific happenings in \\nhis daily life. Some problems involve all \\nkinds of activities. \\nThis “processing” pattern provides for a \\ndesirable pupil-teacher relationship, in that \\nthe teacher no longer feels the need to \\nexpound a principle or passage from the \\ntext. Rather is it possible for him to OC- \\ncupy the position of a real teacher, guide, \\nand counselor to the pupil as the pupil pro- \\nceeds with his business of problem solving, \\ngaining practice in scientific thinking and \\ndoing, and deriving or developing valuable \\nideas as a result of his efforts. This pat- \\ntern minimizes the tendency to indoctrina- \\ntion in science, and emphasizes pupil initi- \\native, resoucefulness, and individuality. \\nThrough science, pupils should be well \\nread in science, skilled in the use of the \\nmethods of science and in scientific think- \\ning. This training should profoundly \\naffect their conduct and ou‘tlook on life. The problems vary in character. \\nHARRY A. CARPENTER, \\nRochester, New York, \\nPublic Schools \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION FROM THE \\nSTANDPOINT OF PSYCHOLOGY \\nThere are at least two questions basic to \\na consideration of the outcomes of science instruction. (1) What is learning? From \\na careful examination of the Thirty-first \\nYearkbook of the National Society for the \\nStudy of Education, it would seem that \\nThorndike’s mechanistic S-R bond theory \\nis accepted as the basis of a psychology of \\nscience learning and teaching. Learning \\nis seen as a “progressive and continuous \\nprocess of forming connections between \\nsituations and responses.” The psychologi- \\ncal principles suggested as a guide to the \\nscience teacher are apparently also those of \\nDr. Thorndike. (2) what are the out- \\ncomes or objectives of science teaching? \\nThere has been a tendency among science \\neducators to place the outcomes of science \\nteaching in four catagories: (a) Specific \\nhabits and motor skills (b) knowledge, \\ncommonly referred to as facts, concepts, \\nprinciples, laws and generalizations (c) un- \\nderstanding and use of the scientific method \\n(d) general patterns of conduct such as \\nideals, interests, tastes, and attitudes, par- \\nticularly scientific attitudes. \\nCertainly it is a fair assumption to say \\nthat there should be no conflict between the \\nproposed or supposed outcomes of science \\nteaching and the psychology of science \\nteaching. According to the S-R bond \\ntheory of learning education becomes a ser- \\nies of changes in the individual which re- \\nsults in the building up of thousands and \\nthousands of S-R bonds. The question is : \\nCan this view be made to apply to all of \\nthe suggested outcomes of science teaching? \\nIt is debatable as to whether this question \\nhas been faced squarely by science educa- \\ntors. There seems to be a shifting between \\na mechanistic conception of learning and \\npurposive learning which is a little bewild- \\nering. This criticism applies especially to \\nthe matter of problem solving and the de- \\nvelopment of scientific attitudes. Is this \\nshifting necessary? Perhaps not. There \\nis something almost irresistably fascinating \\nto me in contemplation of the belief that \\nproblem solving and the development of \\nscientific attitudes may be understood and \\nbest explained on the basis of the S-R \\n 1098237x, 1936, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730200410 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Is not an attitude a definite \\nhabit or a group of habits? In connection \\nwith problem solving we must remember \\nthat; reasoning ability is specialized, that a \\nperson must know a great deal to solve \\nproblems, and that a person must build up \\na number of subtle habits for problem solv- \\ning. After all cannot problem solving be \\nreduced to a number of skills? And are \\nnot skills simply chains of habits? And are \\nnot habits simple S-R bonds? \\nIf the above statements are true then \\nwhat we need to do is to analyze the scien- \\ntific method and scientific attitudes into \\ndefinite habits and skills. The next step \\nwould be to determine through experiment \\nthe learning exercises necessary to develop \\nthese skills and habits. We can be sure \\nthat the laws of learning will apply here \\nas elsewhere. \\nMany of us teach science with the hope \\nthat somehow scientific attitudes will result \\nand that the habit of using the scientific \\nmethod will become a part of the learner \\nas concomitants with the learning of facts \\nand principles. With this belief we are in a \\nfield of chaos. The acquisition of scientific \\nattitudes as a by-product of performing \\nlaboratory experiments, observing demon- \\nstrations and reading textbooks rather than \\nas the product of independent learning ac- \\ntivity is by no means certain. It is crucial \\nto a consideration of all science learning \\nwhether we view science education as \\ngrowth and development of the individual \\nthrough progressive socialization or \\nwhether we envisage science education as a \\nmultitude of specific learnings objectively \\ndetermined and objectively measured. \\nELWOOD D.

AND SCIENCE \\nArt, literature, and music are ways of \\nmaking a living, but there would be little \\nliterature, less art, and no music if hard- \\nheaded humanity did not possess a type of \\nsoftness called appreciation. Science is a \\nfield of practical employment, and there \\nwould be science taught and used even if \\nthere were no pleasure in it, yet throughout \\nthe centuries science has been offered pri- \\nmarily for appreciation to all who could or \\nwould accept it on that basis. \\nExamples of this appeal to interest are \\nto be found all along the line of scientific \\nliterature. What but a book of popular \\nscience was Porta’s Book of Natural \\nMagick, published first in 1556 as a sinall \\nvolume of four chapters ‘when John Bap- \\ntista Porta of Naples was a lad of 15, and \\nexpanded in 1616 to an encyclopedia of \\ntwenty chapters when he was a veteran of \\n65 ! The latter volume was translated into \\nmany languages, including English. \\nFor the next generation there was \\nPhilip’s Technical Curiosities-but let the \\neasy Latin of his fly-leaf describe the \\noffering : \\nTechnica Curiofa, of Joannem Phi1,ip- \\npum, 1644. \\nLibris XII conzprehenfa, quibus varia \\nExperimenta, variaqzte Technafmata, Pnev- \\nmatica, Hydravlica, Hydrotechnica, Me- \\nchanica, Graphica, Cyclometrica, Chrono- \\nmetrica, Automatica, Cabalif tica, aliaque \\nArtis arcana ac miracula, rara, curiofa, in- \\ngeniofa, ntagnamque partem nova & ante- hac inaudita, erzrditi orbis utilitati, defecta- \\ntioni, disceptationique proponuntur. \\nI will match1 the versatility, originality, \\nand pleasing style of these science books for \\nthe delectation of the erudite world against \\nall of their successors. \\nWhat is appreciated by enlightened peo- \\nple?

IS \\nthe work-and-wbo story enjoyed by hero- \\nworshippers ? Who have surpassed the \\nFrank Merriwells of science in their \\nachievements and rewards? Does magic \\nthrill ? Who have rubbed more lamps than \\nthe Aladdins of science? Is a moral lesson \\ndesired as a prescription for self or stu- \\ndent? What literature and logic more \\nnearly points the way to truth and wisdom \\nthan do the philosophers of science? \\nIs appreciation inherited, or acquired? \\nIs one born appreciative, or does one learn \\nso to be? The collective judgment of those \\nwho know the influences of art, literature, \\nand music is that appreciation is predomi- \\nnantly a matter of training, and primarily \\nof early training. It is a matter of back- \\nground, and beginnings are important. \\nThere are definite efforts in this country \\nto foster science appreciation.

Science in the kindergar- \\ntens and earliest grades has its specially \\nadapted literature.* In the intermediate \\ngrades there is a recent flair for profusely \\nillustrated volumess to the delight of many \\nat this age of understanding eagerness. As \\ntexts in general science and biology become \\nmore formal in the junior high school, \\nthere are at least a hundred supplementary \\nvolumes on this level published every year \\nthat shout, “Science is still fun !”* When \\nthe science specialties of senior high school \\nare attacked, a hundred more new non-text \\nbooks cry out, “Science is still inter- \\nesting !”5 \\nFrom kindergarten through high school, \\ntherefore, the opportunities for developing \\nappreciation of science are many--the bene- \\nficiaries, relatively few. \\nA last chance to provide this highly use- \\nful background of appreciation comes with \\nthe freshman year in college. In the reali- \\nzation that, in spite of twelve years in which \\nto do it, the curricula and instruction of the \\nlower levels have not graduated a majority \\nof organized and appreciative minds, a \\nfrantic effort is made to supply the baclr- \\nground and appreciation by means of sun- \\ndry survey and orientation c0urses.G These \\n2Among the newest are Science Stories, two \\nvolumes or more, by Wilbur L. Beauchamp and \\nothers. The Reilly & Lee Co., Chicago. \\n3 For example, Automobiles from Start to \\nFinish, by Franklin M. Re&, Thomas Y. Cro- \\nwell Co., New York; Talking Wires, by Clara \\nLambert, The Maunillan Co., New York. \\n4 Typical of this spirit are The Earth for \\nSam; The Stars for Sam; The Sea for Sam; \\neach by W. Maxwell Reed, Harcourt, Brace & \\nCo., New York. \\n5 At this, and college freshman, level there are \\ncertain books that particularly “hit the mark,” \\nsuch as Stars and Planets by Donald H. Menzel, \\nThe Smallest Living Things by Gary N. Calkins, \\nThe Plant World by C. Stuart Gager, The Races \\nof Man by Robert B. Bean, The Coming of Man \\nby George Grant MacCurdy, and others, all con- \\ncise (150 pages, more or less) and inexpensive \\nvolumes published by The University Society, \\nNew York \\nMost recent and lively are the “new-plan \\ntexts” of the University of Chicago: From Gali- \\nleo to Cosmic Rays-a New Look at Physics, by \\nHarvey B.

Krumbein; Man and are, and will continue to be, necessary in \\nscience until the effective twelve-year pro- \\ngram in science becomes established \\nthroughout the nation. \\nPerhaps-to dodge no duty-we should \\nask a question of our readers. “DO you \\nknow how to develop the appreciation of \\nart, literature, music, and science within \\nyourself and your students?’ If you do \\nnot, there are plenty of ways to find out. \\nGeorge Peabody College for Teachers \\nTHE TEACHER WE DON’T FORGET \\nNot long ago, about one hundred young \\nteachers of science gathered to discuss \\nproblems in science club sponsorship. To \\nsay that they all were there because of \\ncompelling interest in a professional prob- \\nlem would be something of an exaggera- \\ntion. Many, no doubt, would have experi- \\nenced little difficulty in finding more pleas- \\nant and more restful places to spend an \\nevening after a hard day’s work. But, what \\nis one to do, when the supervisor “believes” \\nin science clubs and expects teachers-s- \\npecially the younger ones-to ‘(show pro- \\nfessional spirit” by devoting time to extra- \\ncurricular activities? And so, they came. \\nThere was a program and an outline for \\ndiscussion; but the conference moved inde- \\npendently of any outline through three \\ndifferent phases. \\nIn the beginning, there was a tendency \\nto complain against conditions which make \\nscience club work difficult. Teaching five \\nclasses a day-forty-five pupils in a class- \\nis a tiring load. Besides, a science teacher \\nmust set up and try out demonstrations. \\nAlso, one’s official class and study-hall as- \\nsignment take time and energy. Suppose a \\nschool is on double-session, where can one \\nfind a room available for a club meeting? \\nWho will supply the materials and equip- \\nment?

HOW about \\nclerical help for the club sponsor? Why \\ndon’t supervisors tell us how and help us \\nto manage science clubs? If science clubs \\nare worth so much educationally, why are \\nthey not included in and credited for \\ncurricular requirements ? \\nIf the evening had ended on this note, \\none might have drawn sad conclusions con- \\ncerning the professional spirit of the group \\nor the possibilities of science club work. \\nAs a matter of fact, the impatience and the \\ncomplaining was merely a process of blow- \\ning off steam. The conference soon took \\na different turn and entered its second \\nphase. What is a good science club, any- \\nway? What do you do when you run out \\nof interesting things to do? How do you \\navoid “cliques”? What kind of meetings \\ndo you arrange? What do you do in pho- \\ntography, in radio, in microscopy, astron- \\nomy, etceteru? How many members \\nshould a club have? How do you connect \\ndub work with class work? And so on. \\nAs answers followed questions, note-taking \\nbecame prevalent. It soon became very \\nclear that there wus a technique of success- \\nful science club sponsorship and that the \\ncontinued pooling of sponsor experiences \\nmight lead to a formulation of important \\nelements in that technique. \\nGradually, the discussion developed a \\nthird and final phase which is best described \\nby the question, “What does the pupil get \\nout of a science club?” Many answers \\nwere suggested. Some stressed the fact \\nthat only in science clubs can the teacher \\nreally care for individual differences among \\npupils. Some pointed to club work as the \\nonly true example of pupil learning by \\nexperience. Others showed that the \\nscience-club activity was the only means of \\nintroducing into public schools the spirit \\nand the method of the private “progressive” \\nschool. Still others pointed to the club as \\nan antidote against the tendency to neglect \\nindividual laboratory work. Many urged \\nthe science club as a means of reaching the \\nlarge numbers of non-academically-minded \\npupils now attending high schools because of the economic depression. The most sig- \\nnificant answer of all, and one which im- \\nplied a summation of most of the discus- \\nsion, came from a science club sponsor who \\nsaid : \\n“When I think back to my high school \\ndays, I do not remember subjects; I re- \\nmember teachers. Most of them are vague \\nin my mind ; but the few who stand out are \\nthe ones who used to meet me after class. I \\nremember thein because they gave me \\nthings to do and to think about; they \\nchanged my life. That is why I shall con- \\ntinue to sponsor a club. I know that in a \\nclub atmosphere the pupil can grow educa- \\ntionally and I professionally.” \\nMORRIS MEISTER, \\nHaaren High School, New York City \\nSUCCESS \\nIntrigued and curious after two long dis- \\ntance telephone conversations with a former \\nstudent of mine, regarding the food of \\ncertain live animals in the classroom, I \\nturned my car in the direction of the Sour- \\nland Mountains one fine October afternoon \\nto hunt for the rural school where she is \\nteaching. \\nThe two-room frame building hugged the \\nside of a hill.

The latest part of the \\nstate program is the six-year elementary program. \\nIn New Jersey, Mrs. Atkins stated that there is \\nno state program, every program being in the \\nhands of the local authority. A state survey of \\nthe Junior High School field was begun under \\nthe leadership of Merwin M. Peake of Elizabeth. \\nMrs. Atkins presented some of the items from the \\nreport dealing with pupil percentages and teacher \\nlimitations. She presented conditions in the sen- \\nior-high-school field and outlined difficulties for \\nfuture work. \\nDr. Wildman set forth the aims of the science \\nprogram in Philadelphia. He emphasized the need \\nfor research in this field and inveighed against \\nthe injustice to the pupil in the way of character- \\nbuilding when careless or lazy work is accepted \\nfor promotion or credit. \\nDr. Haworth reviewed the history of the re- \\norganization of science instruction in Washington, \\nD.

He outlined \\nthe needs of getting the plans of supervisors into \\nthe hands of the classroom teachers. He discussed \\nthe correlation between the science program and \\na character education program carried on in \\nWashington in 1934. \\nA tentative report on the work of the Thayer \\nCommission on Secondary School Curriculum \\n(under the Progressive Education Association) \\nwas presented by Mr. Brown of the Lincoln \\nSchool of Teachers College, Columbia University, \\nand a member of the Commission.

In Part B of the program, dealing with plans \\nfor meeting the needs of general education in \\nscience in colleges, Dr. Havighurst opened the \\ndiscussion with a statement of the principles of \\norganization of survey courses in the natural \\nsciences as determined from an analysis of a \\nstudy made of approximately 75 liberal arts col- \\nleges and an estimated 50 teachers colleges and a \\nsmaller number of junior colleges. \\nThe next three papers presented reports of \\npractices at Colgate University by Professor \\nBewkes, at Dartmouth College by Professor \\nPoole, and at Connecticut Teachers College by \\nMr. Underhill. Each speaker traced the develop- \\nment of the origin and organization of the re- \\nspective survey courses, and detailed the content \\nof the courses. It was brought out forcibly that \\nthe criticism of superficiality is not warranted. \\nThe interesting discussion from the floor, par- \\nticipated in by a considerable number of members, \\ncentered about the justification for the courses \\nand their meeting a “basic human need” in the \\ngeneral education of every college man and woman. \\nA telegram was read from Mr. Glenn, repre- \\nsentative of the A.

Mitch- \\nell, secretary of the Association: \\nThe annual meeting of the New York State \\nScience Teachers Association attracted to Syra- \\ncuse the largest attendance in the history of the \\norganization. This record turnout was an index \\nof a felt need on the part of the science teachers \\nfor a more integrated science organization in this \\nstate. \\nThe state science teachers registered a strong \\nsentiment against the action of certain zones \\nwhich have endeavored to eliminate the subject \\nsections of the zone meetings. Records show that \\nnearly 2,000 science teachers attend the various \\nzone meetings. These meetings are regarded as \\nvery helpful to the classroom teacher. Teachers \\nwho had attended the general meetings substi- \\ntuted for the subject section meetings stated that \\nthe program dealt largely with administrative \\nproblems. \\nThe Association agreed that they would like \\nto support one comprehensive national science \\n 1098237x, 1936, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730200109 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The members felt that such an asso- \\nciation might become comparable to the Ameri- \\ncan Medical Association. They further agreed \\nthat such an organization should have an official \\npublication, making use of those already in the \\nfield, and covering the grades from one to twelve. \\nThe Board of Directors provided for a com- \\nmittee to undertake the actual preparation of sug- \\ngested syllabuses for all science activities in \\nthe state from grades one to twelve. The com- \\nmittee will assume the duties of planning, con- \\nstructing, and experimenting with new units of \\nwork. The purpose of this committee is to read- \\njust the science program to meet the needs and \\nphilosophies of progressive education for the child \\nand to provide a really integrated science sequence \\nand curriculum. \\nThe establishing of a clearing house to acquaint \\nthe science teacher with material that will be \\nhelpful to him in teaching will be of inestimable \\nvalue to the teacher in the smaller high school. \\nThe committee plans to pool such science material \\nas may be contributed and to disseminate it as a \\npart of the science letter to be distributed to the \\nteachers at the zone science sectional meetings. \\nThe program, with its emphasis on the theme, \\n“Science Through Pupil Activity,” gave the sci- \\nence classroom teacher valuable information that \\nhad immediate application in the classroom. The \\nmain speakers on the program were Dr. Warren \\nW. fiox, State Supervisor of Science, Dr. P. W. \\nZimmerman, plant physiologist and assistant di- \\nrector of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant \\nResearch, and Dr. Morris Meister, Chairman for \\nthe New York City Student Science Fair, who \\npointed out the advantages of student science \\nclubs. \\nReports on practical student activity were given \\nby Mr. E. L. Osborn of Hudson Falls, Mary \\nNelson of Boonville, Francis Almstead of Clin- \\nton, and William B. Sanford of Painted Post. \\nThe following officers were elected : President, \\nF. T. Mathewson, East View Junior High \\nSchool, White Plains, New York; Vice President, \\nTheodore Shull, Valley Stream High School, \\nValley Stream, New York ; Secretary-Trensztrer, \\nLouis J.

E. H. Schroer, Benson High School, Omaha, \\npresided in the absence of the president, Dr. P. G. \\nJohnson, who is on leave of absence from the \\nUniversity of Nebraska. Fifteen members, in- \\ncluding the chairman of each science section of \\nthe Nebraska State Teachers Association, the \\nchairman of the High School Section of the Ne- \\nbraska Academy of Sciences, and other leading \\nscience teachers from over the state, were present. \\nBusiness considered by the Board included: (1) \\nPlanning the program of the spring meeting of \\nthe Science Teachers Association, which will be \\nheld in conjunction with the Nebraska Academy \\nof Sciences convention; (2) planning for the \\ncoordination of the science section programs of \\nthe State Teachers Association next fall ; (3) the \\npreparation of a list of acceptable science speak- \\ners for general session meetings, the list to be \\npresented to officers of the Nebraska State \\nTeachers Association; (4) reports of member- \\nship and research committees; (5) election of \\nofficers for the coming year. \\nThe Research Committee, Mr. Harold E. Wise, \\nDepartment of Secondary Education, University \\nof Nebraska (chairman); Miss Mary Sturmer, \\nBeatrice, Nebraska ; and Mr. G. J.

Basic philosophies of science educa- \\ntion, in harmony with a basic philosophy of \\ngeneral education, need to be formulated \\nand tested to provide the foundation for the \\nprogram of science teaching. \\nIt is here proposed to state very briefly \\none philosophy of science education which \\nmay merit consideration. \\nThe human organism is in constant inter- \\naction with his environment, both as an in- \\ndividual and as a member of the social \\ngroup. In this interaction he is faced with \\nmaking adjustments. Some of these ad- \\njustments are of the nature of overt activi- \\nties ; others are merely intellectual or con- \\ntemplative. Science, as attitudes, methods \\nof solving problems, and knowledges, may \\naid the individual in making these adjust- \\nments. In fact, many of the adjustments \\ncall especially for science for the reason \\nthat so much of the modern environment is \\na product of the applications of science. \\nEDITOR’S NOTE: In the Ocfober, 1935, issue of \\nthe journal we invited our readers to submit for \\npublication in this section expressions of views \\nrelating to significant aspects of science educa- \\ntion. A number of challenging statements have \\nappeared. We again extend this invitation to \\nthe end that the journal may become an open \\nforum-on the problems of teaching science. In \\nthis and in forthcoming issues there will appear \\na number of editorials in which members of the \\neditorial staff present fundamental philosophies \\nof science education. It is hoped that these \\nstatements will elicit reactions from our readers \\nand, consequently, will add to the value of this \\nsection of the journal. It, therefore, would seem to be true that \\nour science work in the schools, aimed at \\ngeneral education, should find its problems, \\nits content, and its results in the problems \\nof human adjustment and not in the pure \\nscience of a generalized or a specialized \\nnature. Further, it would appear that, for \\nthe laymen, those adjustments which are of \\nthe nature of overt activities, such as attain- \\ning comfort, producing and consuming the \\nessential materials for life, achieving effi- \\nciency and safety in living, maintaining \\nhealth, using and controlling energy in its \\nvarious manifestations, and, in general, dy- \\nnamic living as a worthy member of a \\nsocial group, are of greater significance \\nthan are those adjustments which are \\nmerely intellectual. \\nIf our school science courses can be for- \\nmulated primarily in terms of these real \\nproblems of human adjustment, rather than \\nin terms of the facts or principles of this or \\nthat branch of pure science, we may hope \\n(a) that science education may take a \\nprominent place in general education \\nthrough enabling children and adults to \\nlive more completely and more profitably in \\nthe complex modern environment, (b) that \\nthe science work may be coordinated func- \\ntionally with the work in other fields of the \\nschool curriculum, and (c) that the prob- \\nlems for study in science will provide a \\nbasis for studying science in the spirit of \\nscience and thus yield those attitudes and \\nmethods which are so essential in facing \\nthe real problems of adjustment in a mod- \\nern world. -C. J. P. \\n169 170 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 20, No. 3 \\nSCIENCE TEACHING AT THE \\nCROSSROADS \\nSome recent committee reports and \\ncourses of study in science education reflect \\na point of view and philosophy of science \\nteaching which, if generally accepted and \\nfollowed in all of its implications, may lead \\ninto conditions that are in many ways anal- \\nogous to those from which science educa- \\ntion is just emerging after a long period of \\nineffectiveness and decadence. \\nA hundred years ago science teaching in \\nAmerica was aimed toward the immediate \\nneeds of boys and girls in the living of a \\nrich and full life. Turn through the pages \\nof any of the books published about that \\ntime and it is possible to see this philosophy \\nreflected from cover to cover in the direct \\napproach to the subject, in the simple, \\nhomely, illustrations, and in the emphasis \\non the practical aspects of the subject. \\nThat science teaching did attain this ob- \\njective to a considerable degree is attested \\nby the large enrolments in most of the high \\nschool sciences offered at the time. \\nThe year of 1872 produced the memora- \\nble Harvard Descriptive List of physics \\nexperiments and ushered in an era of sci- \\nence teaching characterized by the domina- \\ntion of the colleges, the formalizing of in- \\nstruction, and the loss of interest by stu- \\ndents in the sciences offered. For more \\nthan four decades science teaching strug- \\ngled under the confining shackles of this \\ndomination which emphasized content val- \\nues to the neglect of the practical and im- \\nmediate needs of the learner. \\nWith the publication of the report of the \\nCommittee on the Reorganization of Sci- \\nence in Secondary Schools, in 1920, it \\nseemed that the period of college domina- \\ntion was about at an end and that a new \\nand more promising era for science teach- \\ning lay ahead. In this publication we see \\nattention again directed toward the learner \\nof science, his needs and his interests. \\nPractical outcomes as well as intellectual \\nare set up as worth while goals in an attempt \\nto secure a more balanced and well-rounded \\nindividual. Other learning experiences than reading and experimenting are pro- \\nposed. But probably the most significant \\naspect of this report is its complete break \\nfrom the content-centered formalism of the \\npreceding four decades and the setting UP \\nof objectives which had real meaning for \\nthe boys and girls who studied science in \\nthe classroom. That the point of view and \\nproposals of this bulletin have had wide- \\nspread influence on science teaching is re- \\nvealed by the recent survey made by Beau- \\nchamp and reported as a portion of the \\nNational Survey of Secondary Education. \\nThe years since the Great War have been \\nchaotic. On every side the youth we teach \\nhas been buffetted by confusion, distress \\nand failure. Change is apparent on every \\nhand. Politics, religion, economics, every \\naspect of modern life is in a condition of \\nflux. We in science education believe that \\nmany of the ills of the present might be \\ncircumvented, or in part alleviated, if peo- \\nple in general could effectively use the sci- \\nentific method of solving problems, and \\ncould attain more of a scientific attitude \\ntoward life in general. \\nScience teaching is at the crossroads. \\nScience teachers must decide upon the basic \\nphilosophy that will guide their offerings \\nto a confused and bewildered younger gen- \\neration. There are two alternatives: (a) a \\nscience in which emphasis is placed on ex- \\nperiences that are vital both as they aid in \\nadjusting to present life and as they train \\nin methods of solving problems that may \\nbe met in later life or (b) a science which \\nin its emphasis on formal content as major \\ngeneralizations may repeat in this decade \\nthe calamity of 1872. The one a forward- \\nlooking dynamic philosophy ; the other a \\nthrowback of more than fifty years. \\nLet us as a group of teachers interested \\nmore in what the content does to the stu- \\ndent than in what the student does to the \\ncontent, pause at the crossroads and then \\nmove ahead. Let us make no left or U \\nturns. \\nELLSWORTH S.

This has \\nbeen the story of the teaching of practi- \\ncally all of the special sciences in high \\nschool and early college years. Physiog- \\nraphy has gone. Only remnants of botany \\nand zoology have survived. Formal physi- \\nology is almost uniformly detested. Physics \\nhas been loosing ground for many years. \\nChemistry has stood still. The more re- \\ncently organized courses in general science, \\ngeneral biology, and the survey courses in \\ncollege have helped to stem the tide for two \\nreasons: (1) They have been required of \\nmany young people in the schools; (2) \\nThey have dealt with applications, topics, \\nproblems, and activities of more immediate \\nconcern to the boys and girls enrolled in \\nthem. \\nNow we are facing a renewed danger of \\na possible loss of interest in training in sci- \\nence fields by our youth in high schools. \\nThis danger arises from the efforts of \\nworkers in science education to find a for- \\nmula built of abstractions about which to \\nset up the patterns of school courses in sci- \\nence. These abstractions are expressed as \\nprinciples, major generalizations, concepts, \\ntraining in scientific method, or the devel- \\nopment of scientific attitudes. \\nThere is no doubt that the formulae ex- \\npressed in terms of these abstractions make \\nlogical centers for course construction from \\nthe adult point of view, or from the point \\nof view of ultimate social worth. The dif- \\nficulty lies in the fact that teachers lose \\nsight of the learning experiences through \\nwhich individuals must reach such abstrac- \\ntions, and center attention upon an attempt to have pupils learn the abstractions with \\nlittle meaningful experiential setting. \\nIn other words, human beings do not \\nlearn through very direct experiences with \\nabstractions. It is even possible that there \\nare large numbers of human beings for \\nwhom such abstractions as a major gen- \\neralization, a scientific method, or a scien- \\ntific attitude will never have any meaning. \\nAnd yet these people live in a present world \\nof science and must learn to get along in it. \\nWe learn largely through contacts with \\nthings, phenomena, or problems of direct \\nand immediate concern to ourselves. It is \\nexceedingly doubtful if very many ‘of us \\nare very much concerned with abstractions \\nas such. Science courses to be successful \\nmust present a possibility for a rather large \\nnumber of experiences that will help young \\npeople interpret applications or phenomena \\nabout them. The problems must be prob- \\nlems of definite application, not vague ques- \\ntions of general concern. “HOW can I \\nkeep the roses in my garden from dying of \\nblackspot?” not “How are plant diseases \\nprevented ?” \\nAt present we know very little about the \\nmore useful experiences that might produce \\nin young people desirable types of science \\ntraining. It is probable that for a given \\ntype of training there are fifty, or more, de- \\nsirable learning experiences. At present \\nwe need an increased emphasis upon the \\neducational problem of finding worth while \\napplications and problems of science that \\nare of definite concern to young people in \\nour existing world. We need a wide range \\nof experimental trial of the learning value \\nof these experiences. Finally we need an \\naccumulation of reports upon such experi- \\nmentation in the literature of science \\nteaching. \\nRALPH K.

The first item of business \\nwas the report of the Secretary-Treasurer, S. R. \\nPowers. The reading of the minutes of the \\nmeeting in Atlantic City (February 1935) was \\ndispensed with for the reason that they had been \\ndistributed to the members by mail. The report \\nof the Treasurer, which is included herewith, \\nwas read and approved. \\nThe next items of business were the reports \\nof committees. \\n1. The reading of the minutes of the Executive \\nCommittee was dispensed with for the reason \\nthat they had been distributed to the members \\nby mail. The minutes were approved. \\n2. The report of the Committee on Constitu- \\ntional Revision. Following the requirements \\nof the Constitution, this Committee prepared \\nand distributed by mail to the membership the \\nproposed revisions of the Constitution The \\nrevisions as proposed were adopted and the \\nCommittee dismissed. (A copy of the re- \\nvised constitution and By-Laws was sent to \\nmembers.) \\n3. The report of the Committee on Rotation \\nand Tenure of Office. This Committee, \\nworking in cooperation with the Committee \\non Constitutional Revision, had submitted its \\nrecommendations to the latter Committee. \\nThese recommendations were included in the \\nproposed revision of the Constitution and \\nwere adopted in adopting the report of the \\nCommittee on Constitutional Revision. The \\ncommittee was dismissed. \\n4. The report of the Committee on Publications \\nwas submitted. It was regularly moved and \\nseconded that the report be adopted and in- \\ncluded in the minutes sent to members. A \\ncopy is on file in the secretary’s office. It Webb, Hanor A. \\nWhitman, Walter G. was regularly moved and seconded that Parts \\nI and I11 of the report be referred to the \\nEditor of SCENCE EDUCATION for his con- \\nsideration; that Part I1 be referred to the \\nCommittee of Five; and that the Committee \\non Publications be continued with instruc- \\ntions to develop further the program sug- \\ngested in Part IV of the report. \\n5. The following report of the Committee CO- \\noperating with the Committee on the Place \\nof Science in Education of the A. A. A. S. was \\nsubmitted and approved. \\nThe Chairman reported for the Committee \\nas follows: \\nIn view of the fact that the A. S. T. A. was \\ninitiated at Boston in 1933 and tentatively \\norganized in Pittsburgh in December 1934, \\nand was finally organized in St. Louis with \\nduly elected officers, and having had pre- \\nsented a proposed constitution, it is our judg- \\nment that the N. A. R S. T. accept the invita- \\ntion of the officers of the A. S. T. A. to become \\nan affiliated organization. This recommenda- \\ntion by the Chairman was made as a motion \\nwhich was seconded by Dr. Ralph K. \\nWatkins. \\nIt was pointed out that the proposed con- \\nstitution of the A. s. T. A. provides that to be- \\ncome final it must be approved by the first \\nfive charter affiliated organizations. By this \\nmeans the question of affiliation dues for each \\nofficial representative on the Board of Direc- \\ntors is subject to approval by these charter \\naffiliating organizations. \\nAfter considerable discussion it was moved \\nand carried that the problem be referred to \\na committee consisting of the retiring Presi- \\ndent of the N. A. R. S. T., the President of \\nthe A. S. T. A., the President of the Depart- \\nment of Science Instruction of the N. E. I., \\nand the President-elect of the N. A. R. S. T., \\nfor further consideration and recommenda- \\ntion. \\nThis committee met as instructed with Mr. \\nWhitman acting as Chairman. After con- \\nsiderable discussion the committee voted to \\nrecommend that the N. A. R. S. T. Sliate \\nwith the A. S. T. A. This recommendation \\nwas presented at the next business meeting of \\nthe N. A. R. S. T. and approved. \\nHARRY A. CARPENTER, \\nChairman. \\n6. The report of the Committee to Draw up a \\nList of Active Investigators in the Field of \\nScience Education was approved and the \\ncommittee continued. The list has been sent \\nto members. \\n7. The report of the Program Committee, as \\nmailed to members, was approved and the \\nCommittee dismissed. \\n8. The Committee on Resolutions made a pre- \\nliminary report and asked permission to \\nreport again at the Monday meeting. This \\npermission was granted. \\n 1098237x, 1936, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730200313 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Laton \\nBefore attempting any definition of the phi- \\nlosophy underlying a science program in general \\neducation two preliminary statements with re- \\ngard to it may well be made. First of all, it \\nmust be a philosophy held by teachers themselves, \\none which actually guides their work with chil- \\ndren in the classroom rather than one which is \\nrelegated to a few unread paragraphs in a lesson \\nplan or a course of study. Second, it is one \\nwhich considers education as a whole, with \\nscience making a contribution to the whole, \\nrather than one which concerns itself only with \\nscience. \\nIt is comparatively simple to make a general \\nformulation of a philosophy of education with \\nwhich almost every one will agree, at least ver- \\nbally. The Science Committee of the Commis- \\nsion of the Progressive Education Association \\nstates in one report, “The aim of general educa- \\ntion is to promote the continuous reconstruction, \\nimprovement, and enrichment of individual and \\nsocial life through the orientation of the indi- \\nvidual in the basic relationships of living.” \\nThese basic relationships they list as six. Edu- \\ncation should orient students better in these re- \\nlationships, not primarily by teaching them facts \\nabout these relationships, but by helping them to \\nachieve certain educational values within them. \\nSimilarly, the Bureau of Educational Research \\nin Science bases its work on the general thesis \\nthat education should be concerned with what is \\nsignificant for human living and thinking, that \\nit should provide opportunity for students to de- \\nvelop ways of thinking and acting and feeling \\nwhich are consistent with the sum total of human \\nknowledge, and which will contribute to the wel- \\nfare of individuals and of groups of individuals. \\nSeveral research associates are now at work re- \\nviewing the literature of science to find what \\nseems to have significance for a better under- \\nstanding of ourselves, our relations to other hu- \\nman beings, and our relations to the rest of the \\nanimate and inanimate universe, since these are \\nthe relationships within which we must act and \\nthink and feel. \\nAnother group is trying to discover something \\nabout learning by giving children opportunity \\nto explore, as widely as is possible in school situations, certain great fields of human knowl- \\nedge about themselves, about other people, about \\nthe universe, and the relations between them. \\nOut of these experiences each child will build \\nfor himself certain ways of thinking, feeling, and \\nacting. One problem then becomes to discover: \\nhow many and what new ideas they develop; \\nwhether they learn to think more critically; how \\ntheir overt behavior is changed; what new inter- \\nests, attitudes, and appreciations they develop ; \\nhow they change their way of looking at life in \\ngeneral. Science makes a contribution to each \\nof these ; the educational philosophy underlying \\na science program in general education draws our \\nattention to them all as we teach and as we \\nevaluate teaching. \\nTRENDS OF SCIENCE REVISION IN THE SCHOOLS OF \\nTHE AIKXN EXPERIMENT \\nBy A. N. Zechiel \\nThe experimental work going on in the thirty \\nschools participating in the work of the Aikin \\nCommission shows a wide degree of variation. \\nThe science departments of the thirty schools are \\nin general less active in experimentation than \\nare some other departments, notably the social \\nstudies. In no one school are all the trends sum- \\nmarized below to be found. On the other hand, \\neach of the trends indicated is evident in more \\nthan one school. The very word “trend” indi- \\ncates a dynamic condition rather than a static \\none, so we find few places where teachers would \\nbe willing to say. they had achieved perfection \\nalong the line they are pursuing. The following \\nstatements therefore, represent the general di- \\nrections toward which the experimental work \\nis pointing. \\n1. Setting up objectives of science teaching in \\nterms of desired student behavior, so concretely \\nstated that they can be used as criteria for the \\nselection of content and methodology. \\n2. Greater emphasis upon teaching for the de- \\nvelopments of attitudes, appreciations, and skills, \\nand less emphasis upon content mastery. \\n3. Greater use of the scientific method in \\nlaboratory work. An increase in the amount of \\nquantitative work and a decrease in descriptive \\nand verification experiments. \\n4. Individualization of work and standards of \\nachievement within a group. \\n5. Fusion courses, such as: (a) Physical sci- \\nence (fusion of physics and chemistry, in some \\ncases also geology, physical geography, astron- \\no.niy); (b) Biology and health courses; (c) \\nScience and mathematics ; (d) Science and social \\nstudies. \\n6. Testing for objectives rather than content \\ntesting alone. \\nIn many schools the curriculum as such, re- \\ncorded in cold print, is not startling in its new- \\nness or originality. The same materials are \\navailable and used. However, the clear defini- \\ntion of objectives in terms that lend themselves \\nto some form of systematic evaluation is pro- \\n 1098237x, 1937, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210209 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

There \\nseems to be little doubt that for the non-college \\nstudent many of the courses offered are superior \\nto the traditional courses in physics, chemistry, \\nand biology. Whether the college student is like- \\nwise benefited remains to be seen. The author \\nbelieves that for the college student who does not \\nintend to specialize in science in college the same \\nconclusion will be valid. Present trends in col- \\nlege courses seem to be to delay specialization \\nuntil the latter years of the course, which seems \\nto indicate that specialization is decidedly out of \\nplace in high-school curricula. \\nSOME CONSIDERATIONS GOVERNING THE ESTABLISH- \\nMENT OF SCIENCE COURSES TO MEET THE NEEDS \\nOF GENERAL EDUCATION AT THE SENIOR- \\nHIGH-SCHOOL LEVEL \\nBy H. Emmett Brown \\nThe original statement of the aim of general \\neducation put forth by the Science Committee \\nworking under the direction of the Progressive \\nEducation Association’s Commission on Secon- \\ndary Curriculum was: “The aim of general edu- \\ncation is to promote the continuous reconstruc- \\ntion, improvement, and enrichment of individual \\nand social life through the orientation of the in- \\ndividual in the basic relationships of living.” \\nHowever we may attempt to state our ideal of \\ngeneral education (the committee is considering \\na new statement of this aim) the ideal is prob- \\nably clearly enough held by educators to afford \\nguidance to curriculum reform. The acceptance \\nof this ideal and its rigorous application will re- \\nsult in a number of changes in senior-high-school \\nscience. These changes would probably be of \\nfour main kinds. \\n1. Changes in Content.-(a) Elimination of \\ndead wood, e.g., detailed work on preparation, \\nproperties and occurrence in chemistry, work on \\nvector forces in physics, details of animals and \\nplant structure in. biology; (b) Addition of ma- \\nterial that does contribute to orientation, e.g., \\nnew material from certain other fields of science, \\nas the geology of the region, certain aspects of \\nastronomy and anthropology ; (c) Increased so- \\ncial emphases, e.g., the effect of the machine \\nstudied along with the machine, the bad physio- \\nlogical and social effects of noise in connection \\nwith the study of sound, consumer education in \\nconnection with much of the work in biology \\nand chemistry; (d) As suggested in (b) above, \\ncertain new materials may be added. This sug- \\ngests that we do not need to worry too much \\nabout subject-matter boundaries. Neither is it a \\nvirtue in itself to tear them down. \\n2. Changes in Organization.-(a) Organization \\nof science instruction should not be dictated com- \\npletely by the content. Instead it may be deter- \\nmined by the needs of the group and its individ- \\nuals and certain considerations growing out of \\nthe school program of experimentation; (b) Or- ganization shall be such as to help to secure inte- \\ngration, e.g., a unit in light which is introduced \\nthrough work on color and vision, related to \\nbiology in its study of the structure of the eye, \\nrelated to social material on eye strain, related to \\nthe flow of energy from the sun, related to art \\nin its interpretation of color, and tied in with the \\nwhole theme of the flow of energy over the \\nearth’s surface and throughout the universe. \\n3. Changes in Types of Activities.-In place of \\nthe usual practice of selecting activities solely \\n(in spite of violent assertion to the contrary) for \\ntheir function in helping to develop understand- \\nings, activities would be chosen for three pur- \\nposes: (a) to develop understandings (as be- \\nfore); (b) to develop educational values; (c) \\nto allow for individual interests and to meet indi- \\nvidual needs. It is apparent that the same activ- \\nity may develop more than one of the above. \\nOthers would have quite distinct functions. Im- \\nplicit in the three points of view seem to be: (a) \\nactivities are not chosen to produce laboratory \\ntechnicians or for other highly specialized pur- \\nposes, except for the occasional person, (b) work \\nrather widely separated from that of the main \\ngroup may go on with certain individuals, (c) \\nall activilies are not determined in advance. Stu- \\ndents have a share in planning and determining \\nthe length and kind of teaching unit. \\n4. Changes in Method.-Much of what has \\nbeen said before has a direct bearing on method. \\nIn addition it may be said: (a) The approach \\nshould be through the student, e.g., work in \\nlight, through vision ; in sound, with hearing and \\nthe human voice; in machines with the idea of \\nthe human body as a machine, or how machines \\naid us in our daily work: in chemical changes \\nwith the chemistry of the life processes, and (b) \\nIf activities are selected to produce other than \\nsubject-matter understandings, then, and in any \\ncase, a more careful and expanded program of \\nevaluation must go on. \\nWHAT ARE SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING \\nTHE CLASSROOM TEACHER IN ACCEPTING AND \\nPRAC’MCING THE AIM OF GENERAL EDUCA- \\nTION IN HIS DAILY WORK? \\nBy Wilmarth I. Jacobs \\nOne basic difficulty facing the classroom \\nteacher arises from a narrow, utilitarian con- \\nception of subject-matter in terms of financial \\nreturns. The student must be educated to the \\npoint of realization that he must include in his \\nbackground much that is contributory, indirectly \\nrather than directly, to his success. \\nEvery classroom teacher faces a difficulty \\nwhich arises from faulty preparation on the part \\nof his students.

Powers \\nOur society is one of individuals whose activi- \\nties are continually reconstructing it. Thus it is \\nimportant in educational planning to recognize \\nthese influences under (I) the natural environ- \\nment, (11) the self, and (111) society. \\nI. The influences of the natural environment \\nare seen from consideration of (A) man’s knowl- \\nedge of the world and of its changes through \\ntime, and (B) his control and use of the natural \\nenvironment. \\nA. Man’s knowledge of the world and of its \\nchanges through time includes the scientific \\naspects of man’s world model : his concepts of \\nhistory, nature, and structure of the physical \\nuniverse ; his realization of the interrelations \\nof living things and of their dependence upon \\nconditions of the physical environment; his \\ntheory of the evolution of life and of society; \\nhis understanding of the processes of nature \\nas they relate to and condition thinking and \\nacting, and of the nature and limitations of the \\nscientific descriptions of the world. \\nB. Controls with their implications for social \\nliving include (1) controls that are useful for \\nmaintenance of personal and public health, par- \\nticularly controls of bacterial disease, of con- \\nditions necessary for production of foods, and \\nof conditions permitting a reasonable degree \\nof physical activity; (2) controls that are use- \\nful (a) in the cultivation of plants and the \\nrearing of animals for food, clothing and shel- \\nter; (b) in the use of plants for decorative \\neffecis and in prevention of soil erosion; (c) \\nin the rearing and care of animals for pets, for \\nbeasts of burden, and for such recreational \\nactivities as riding, hunting, and fishing; and \\n(d) for protection of plants and animals from \\nparasitic pests; (3) control of energy and of \\nits technologic utilization, and (4) controls \\nfor technologic utilization of material re- \\nsources. \\n11. The influences of the self are seen irom \\nconsideration of (A) the objective self and (B) \\nthe subjective self. \\nA. The self, viewed objectively, is essentially \\nthe physiological self, knowledge of which \\ndeals with (a) the exchange of matter and en- \\nergy between the body and the external en- \\nvironment; (b) growth and development ; (c) \\ncharacteristics of physical vigor and how to \\nmaintain it; (d) behavior in response to en- \\nvironmental fdCt0rs and as affected by physio- logical conditions ; (e) sex and reproduction, \\nand (f) the relations between parents and off- \\nspring. Out of these influences there arise the \\nindividual’s persistent questions concerning his \\nown normality. \\nB. The subjective self suggests psychological \\nand anthropological knowledge of the growth \\nand development of the mental and emotional \\nlife. This includes ideals and attitudes, the \\ncreative and reflective personal life, and quali- \\nties of personality and personality differences. \\nFrom these also there come the persistent \\nquestions of normality. \\n111. The influences of society arc seen from \\nconsideration of (A) the family and (B) the \\nGreat Community. \\nA. Family relationships suggest knowledge \\nof (a) group psychology; (b) scientific needs \\nof the home; (c) adjustments in matters of \\nsex including birth control; (d) care and \\nfeeding of children, and (e) adjustments \\nbetween parents and children. \\nB. The Great Community suggests (a) racial \\ndifferences; (b) social and political institu- \\ntions-the school, the church, and the club, and \\nlocal, national, and international governmental \\nagencies, and (c) social-civic concerns such \\nas marriage and divorce, child welfare, crime \\nprevention, housing, and religious and racial \\nconflicts which are not centcred in organized \\ninstitutions. This category, more than any \\nother, includes man’s thoughts about the nature \\nand origins of knowledge and about its bear- \\nings upon his cultural life; it includes the rela- \\ntions of the individual to the traditions and \\nideals of his society, to its standards of truth \\nand value, its modes of thinking, its ways of \\nacting and ieeling-in short, it includes the \\nrelations of the individual to the funded ex- \\nperience and social heritage of the human race. \\nARTICULATION OF HIGH-SCHOOL CHEMISTRY AND \\nCOLLEGE CHEMISTRY \\nBy Wm. B. Meldrum \\nIn view of the high quality of work in chem- \\nistry as offered in many preparatory schools it IS \\nno longer desirable to include in the same gen- \\neral chemistry course in college those who have \\nhad chemistry in school with those who have had \\nno chemistry. Nor is the plan of offering two \\ngeneral chemistry courses, one elementary for \\nthose who have not had chemistry in school, and \\none more advanced for those who have had \\nchemistry previously, much more satisfactory. \\nThis plan is essentially a procedure of retarding \\nthe better-prepared students until the others have \\ncaught up to them so that all may enter the same \\nsecond-year course. A much more desirable \\nset-up of courses, which has worked well at \\nHaverford College for several years, is to offer a \\nfirst elementary course for beginners and a more \\nadvanced course into which both those who have \\ntaken the beginning course in college and those \\n 1098237x, 1937, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210209 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

This advanced course, \\nwhich is given concurrently with the laboratory \\nwork in systematic qualitative analysis, deals \\nwith the fundamental chemical theory, with the \\nmain emphasis upon the ionization theory and its \\napplication to soiliation effects and to electrolytic \\neffects, and upon the theory of atomic structure \\nand its application to explain and correlate the \\nproperties of substances and the mechanisms of \\nchemical reactions. It includes, however, a re- \\nview of the fundamental laws and theories of \\nchemistry and the development of the back- \\nground, both factual and historical, of the ioniza- \\ntion theory and the theory of atomic structure. \\nThe course not only affords a general view of \\nthe science of chemistry but also prepares the \\nstudent for the application of physical chemistry \\nin the more advanced courses. Several years’ \\nexperience has shown that the grade in the chem- \\nistry examination of the College Entrance Ex- \\namination Board is the best basis for the predic- \\ntion of a student’s success in such a course dis- \\ntinctly more advanced than the usual general \\nchemistry course in colleges. \\nREPORT OF THE NEW WORK OF THE COLLEGE \\nENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD \\nBy Robert N. Hilkert (as reported by the \\nSecretary) \\nMr. Hilkert reported on the proposed revision \\nof entrance examinations in science, a sequence \\nto the recommendation “that steps be taken \\ntoward the realization of a more nearly continn- \\nous secondary curriculum in science and a com- \\nprehensive examina,tion in science be held by the \\nBoard. . . .” \\nThe following statements are copied from a \\nleaflet on the proposed revisions. \\n“With respect to present examination offerings \\nof the Board, the Commission believes that . . . \\nthe Board should restrict itself to the major \\nsubject.s : physics, chemistry, biology. \\n“With respect to the nature of the present ex- \\naminations, the Commission is of the opinion \\nthat existing examining methods are in some \\nrespects inadequate and in need of improvement. \\nIt is therefore recommended that, during the \\nnext four years, the Board make an intensive \\nstudy of the effectiveness of examining pro- \\ncedures in biology, chemistry and physics.” \\nAs for future examinations “the Commission \\nrecognizes three levels of attainment. . . . \\n“The scheme of examinations recommended \\nhere may be summarized as follows: \\nFirst level-biology, chemistry, physics. \\nSecond level-biological sciences, physical \\nThird level-biology, chemistry, physics, in- sciences. \\ncluding mathematics gamma.” \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nDENA D. UNGEMACH, \\nSecretary- Treasurer A meeting of the Executive Council was called \\nimmediately following the regular meeting. A \\nnumber of questions from Mr. Meister’s report, \\nprogram, and membership were discussed. It \\nwas the consensus of the group that its members \\nshould meet again some time after the A. A. \\nA. S. meeting in late December. The Council \\nadjourned to meet at the call of the President. \\nSecreiary DENA D.

Whitman. The first item of \\nbusiness was the report of the Secretary-Trea- \\nsurer, S. Ralph Powers. The reading of the \\nminutes was dispensed with for the reason that \\nthey had been distributed to the members by \\nmail. The report of the Treasurer was presented \\nand accepted.

Bedell, Chairman. \\n2. A report of the Committee on Publications \\nwas made by the Secretary in the absence \\nof the Chairman, E. D. Heiss. The \\nreport was accepted as one of progress. \\n3. Report of the Committee of Five, Ralph K. \\n“Brief progress reports of the following \\ncommittees were made (1) by M. L. Robert- \\nson and Gerald Craig on certain phases of the \\nwork of the Committee on Elementary School \\nScience; (2) by Ellsworth S. Obourn for the \\nCommittee on Secondary School Science. \\nThese reports indicated progress in the work \\nundertaken by these two committees. It \\nwould seem advisable to continue the work \\nof these committees. \\nNo report was available from the Com- \\nmittee on Science for Adult Education, nor \\nfrom the Committee on Junior College Sci- \\nence. These two committees were later than \\nthe others in getting under way. Little has \\nbeen accomplished by them to date. It was \\nleft to the Executive Committee, in consulta- \\ntion with the chairman of these cummittees, \\nto determine whether or not their work should \\nbe continued. \\nIn the absence of the chairman of the Com- \\nmittee on Elementary Science, the complete \\nreport for that committee was not available. \\nThe report was mailed to the chairman of \\nthe Committee of Five at the meeting but was \\nlost in transit. A copy of the chairman’s re- \\nport will be made available to the Executive \\nCommittee. \\nThe chairman of the Committee on the \\nEducation of Science Teachers, R. K. Wat- \\nkins, presented a 25-page mimeographed re- \\nport for the committee. The report consisted \\nof a statement of issues confronting those \\nconcerned with the training of science teach- \\ners, a resolution of these issues in terms of \\navailable published studies, and bibliographies \\ndealing with each issue. The issues were \\npresented by the committee to the organiza- \\ntion at the St. Louis meeting. A few copies \\nof the mimeographed report are still available \\nfrom the chairman. \\nIt was agreed that this committee should \\nbe continued. The chairman was instructed \\nto present a plan for continued investigation \\nby the committee. \\nAn informal report of the work of the \\nCommittee of Five as a whole was presented \\nby the chairman, R. K. Watkins. It was \\nrecommended that the name, “Committee of \\nFive,” be dropped in order that a flexible \\ngroup of committees which vary in number \\nfrom time to time could be established. \\nIt was suggested that those committees be \\ncontinued by the Executive Committee that Watkins, Clzairman. give promise of setting up a program of in- \\nvestigation that can engage the cooperative \\nefforts of the members of the organization. \\nIt was recommended that the chairman of \\ncommittees break up the work agreed upon \\nby each committee so that pieces of the total \\nmight be done by individuals, or possibly by \\ninstitutions, working at some distance from \\none another. It would seem feasible for the \\nchairman to synthesize the parts into one re- \\nport, or for a committee to organize its \\nmaterials into one report at a meeting held \\nat the time of the annual meeting of the \\nN.A.R.S.T. Assignment of work and agree- \\nment upon policies among members of a com- \\nmittee can be carried out by correspondence. \\nIt does not seem wise to spend organiza- \\ntion funds for committee meetings, nor as a \\nmeans of subsidizing actual research. Com- \\nmittees can reasonably expect from the \\norganization, funds for correspondence, dupli- \\ncating, and for the ultimate publication of \\nreports of work accomplished. Actual inves- \\ntigalion will need to be carried out by individ- \\nuals as members of a committee, or by indi- \\nviduals with the aid of local institutions.” \\nRalph K. Watkins, Clzairman. \\n4.

The Executive Committee was instructed to \\ngive consideration to publicizing the work \\nof the Association. \\n6. Report of preliminary committee on Problems \\nof Guidance in Science, Ralph C. Bedell, \\nChairman. \\n“1. There is general agreement among educa- \\ntors on the basic philosophy of gui- \\ndance. This philosophy is variously \\nstated but in general, means that the \\nfunction of guidance is to enable each \\nstudent to make the best possible \\nadjustment for himself to the society \\nin which he lives. Guidance workers \\ngenerally delimit such adjustment to \\nsome such phases as the following: \\na. health; b. educational; c. voca- \\ntional ; d. personal. \\n2. From the standpoint of science education \\nit appears that it would be justifiable \\nto assume a basic philosophy stated in \\nthe following terms : \\nThe function of guidance in relation \\nto science education is primarily one \\nwhich brings each student into the best \\npossible adjustment to the scientific \\nphases of society. \\nThis would indude essentially best \\nadjustment to science courses in school, \\nscientific vocations, and scientific \\naspects of health. \\n 1098237x, 1937, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210209 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Experts in the field of guidance are not \\nin agreement on the methodology which \\nis best suited to the accomplishment \\nof the above purposes. After a rather \\ncareful survey of the field, it is the \\nsuggestion of the committee that the \\nbest methodology will be based upon a \\ncomplete, permanent, cumulative, case \\nhistory of each student. \\nIn this case history would be included \\nacademic records, personal records, \\nfree-time activity records, health rec- \\nords, and such other material that \\nwould seem to be significant. Each \\nstudent’s education would then be pre- \\nscribed for him in terms of this case \\nhis tory. \\nThis would mean that the essential \\npoints of guidance would consist of: \\na. description ; b. diagnosis ; c. pre- \\nscription ; d. prognosis. \\nScientific education prescribed in this \\nmanner would constitute the nearest \\napproach to a scientific method of \\nteaching science. \\n4. The N.A.R.S.T. could contribute valuable \\ninformation to the field of guidance by \\nsponsoring investigations which would \\nassist in the determination of the pre- \\ndictive value of various measurable \\nhuman traits, singularly and in com- \\nbination. \\nAs one illustration of the above, the \\norganization might sponsor an investi- \\ngation which would attempt to de- \\ntermine the types of people who are \\nbest fitted for laboratory method of \\ninstruction as in contrast with those \\nwho could profit most from the lecture \\nmethod of instruction. Most investiga- \\ntions on the efficiency of the lecture \\nmethod have not taken into considera- \\ntion such pupil traits as manipulation \\nrate, clerical aptitude, finger dexterity, \\nspatial relations, and the like. This \\ngroup might sponsor a series of such \\ninvestigations which would try to dis- \\ncover the types of people who could \\nprofit best from each type of science \\ninstruction. \\nAnother example of the type of inves- \\ntigation this organization might sponsor \\nwould he a matter of differential pre- \\ndiction of success in various non- \\nscience courses compared with various \\nscience courses. This appears to be a \\nvaluable field which has had relatively \\nlittle exploration. \\n5. In view of the increased guidance activ- \\nities of schools, it would seem desirable \\nfor the N.A.R.S.T. to continue and en- \\nlarge the present guidance committee \\nin view of conducting investigations \\nalong the above and similar lines.” \\nRalph C.

Quotation of three paragraphs from \\nthe letter will give the major purposes of \\nthe new group: \\nInstitute for Propaganda Analysis is a non- \\nprofit corporation organized for scientific re- \\nsearch in methods used by propagandists in \\ninfluencing public opinion. The institute will \\nconduct a continuous survey and analysis of \\npropagandas. By objective and scientific scru- \\ntiny of the agencies, techniques, and devices utilized in the formation of public opinion, it \\nwill seek to show how to recognize propaganda \\nand appraise it. \\nThere is today especial need for propaganda \\nanalysis. America is beset by a confusion of \\nconflicting propagandas, a Babel of voices, \\nwarnings, charges, counter-charges, assertions, \\nand contradictions assailing us continually \\nthrough press, radio, and newsreel. These \\npropagandas are disseminated by political par- \\nties, labor unions, business organizations, farm \\norganizations, patriotic societies, churches, \\nschools, and other agencies; also by word of \\nmouth by millions of individuals. \\nIf American citizens are to have clear under- \\nstanding of conditions and what to do about \\nthem, they must be able to recognize propa- \\nganda, to analyze, and to appraise it. \\nIn the second monthly letter, November, \\n1937, attention is directed to ways ol detect- \\ning propaganda. Seven coninion propa- \\nganda devices are listed and analyzed. The \\nprefatory statement in this second letter is \\nas follows : \\nWe are fooled by propaganda chiefly because \\nwe don’t recognize it when we see it. It may \\nbe fun to he fooled but, as the cigarette ads used \\nto say, it is more fun to know. We can more \\neasily recognize propaganda when we see it if \\nwe are familiar with the seven common propa- \\nganda devices. These are: \\n1. The Name Calling Device \\n2. The Glittering Generalities Device \\n3. The Transfer Device \\n4. The Testimonial Device \\n5. The Plain Folks Device \\n6. The Card Stacking Device \\n7. The Band Wagon Device \\nIt would appear from these letters that \\nthe new organization has taken steps to \\ncarry out a much-needed prograin of search \\ninto propaganda of various kinds. It is \\nhoped that the true spirit of scientific re- \\nsearch will carry forward the good work. \\nIf, through objective analysis of the ways \\nand means of propaganda, the organization \\ndoes enlighten the intelligent citizen, prog- \\nress will have been made in the direction of \\nsubstituting open-mindedness and discovery \\n251 252 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 21, No. 5 \\nof truth for prejudice or bias and acceptance \\nof emotionalized utterances.

This \\ninitiation thus becomes a monient of self- \\nanalysis and self-direction in relation to \\nthose personal qualities of power, endur- \\nance, vision and trustworthiness, which are \\nessential for a happy conipanionship in a \\nlife-time venture.

These gifts in one person are coin- \\nparatively rare and are to be highly treas- \\nured and cultivated by those who possess \\nthem. They are the criteria by which it \\nwill be determined for each of you whether \\nyou shall continue as a comrade iii research \\nor fall by the way-side.

It is \\nthe duty of one who joins a field party to \\nkeep himself fit. The fact that many of \\nthose who have achieved in the past havc \\nsucceeded in spite of the neglect of physi- \\ncal health is no justification for any young \\ninvestigator to take the risk. \\nIndeed, the recognition of the possibili- \\nties and the significance of physical fitness \\nis an acliievenient of modern science. It is \\na matter of intellectual ecoiionly. The \\nscholar is now not only expected to show \\ngood judgment in regard to matters of \\nphysical health ; but, in the culture of today, \\nthe maintenance of health has become a \\nmoral question. There are two kinds of \\nsuicide : one where the individual snaps out \\nhis life in a moment, the other where he \\nspills it gradually in defiance of reason and \\nmorals pertaining to health. The intensive \\nresearcher must work hard, but he must \\nalso niaster the art of loafing for relaxation. \\nThere are three taproots which furnish \\nthe vitality aiid drive in a man’s life; \\nnamely, the tmdencies for the perpetuation \\nof the species, the perpetuation of the in- \\ndividual and the perpetuation of the social \\ngroup. The last is a comparatively late \\nacquirement in the process of evolution \\nand is most in deniand in tlie higher huinan \\npursuits. IJnselfishness, the willingness to \\nshare in labor and the fruits thereof, and \\nthe ability to rultivate the welfare of asso- \\nciates in action, is given a most severe test \\nin the field of scientific pursuits. Broad \\nhorizons, cultured synipathies, and the \\nspirit of sacrifice count much in intellectual \\nexpeditions. “Laboratory rat” is justly a Editorials and Educational News \\n20 1 202 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 21, No. 4 \\nterm of scoi-1i for the investigator whose \\nsocial life is rat-like. \\nThe products of research constitute \\nwealth and there are peculiar nioral re- \\nquirements which must become fixed habits \\nin the pursuit and hoarding of this type of \\nwealth. In research, as in ordinary-life \\nmorality, the problem is not that of com- \\nplying with ordinary rules and sanctions, \\nbut rather a sense of joy in living and the \\ncultivation of intellectual generosity and in- \\ntegrity in applying the findings of science \\nto life. \\nThe beautiful life is our goal. The sense \\nof beauty which puts the investigator en \\nraapport with nature in wonder and awe is \\na priceless gift to the investigator and his \\nassociates. Whether he turns to the micro- \\norganism in the dirty water below, to the \\nmacro-organism in the star-filled skies \\nabove, or to the manifestation of the power \\nof mind within himself, he encounters \\nbeauty. Aesthetic insight, based upon the \\nlaws of nature, is a precious jewel in the \\nscientific mind. \\nReligion has done much to block science ; \\nbut, in the long run, it has been a moulder \\nof the finer traits in the scientific mind, \\nwhich may be described in part in religious \\nterms, as an attitude of reverence for and \\na fellowship with those forces in and above \\nnature which are manifested in the pro- \\ngressive realization of truth, goodness and \\nbeauty. \\nAs you accept our hand of fellowship, \\nyou also enter into a higher order of rela- \\ntionship, fellowship with the sages of the \\nworld, as revealed in the history of science. \\nLearn from them, love them, and live with \\nthem as your comrades. \\nC. E. SEASHORE, \\nUniversity of Iowa. \\nWHAT SHOULD RE THE PLACE OF \\nSCIENCE IN EDUCATION \\nThe April, 1937, issue of Science Educa- \\ntion contained paired articles by representa- \\ntives of the natural and social sciences \\nwhich set the author thinking of the prob- \\nlem above. The problem has been develop- ing through the reading and attempts to \\ninterpret the prefaces of textbooks of \\nscience, and the textbooks and articles \\non science teaching most emphasizing \\nscience as classified knowledge and method ; \\na series of articles in Sclzool Scieiice and \\nMatlzeiizatics on : “Is This the Scientific \\nMethod?” ; attenrlaiice at meetings of sci- \\nence teachers and teachers of science teach- \\ners. The result has beeu confusion due to \\nthe difficulty of reconciliation of the ideas \\npresented in the name of science with nieth- \\nods of presentation and practical applica- \\ntion. \\nBefore the question can be answered, \\neven tentatively, the meanings assigned to \\n“Science” and ’’Education” must be stated. \\nBroadly, the latter may be thought of as a \\nprocess by which an individual may be pre- \\npared to join positively, productively and \\nappreciatively in the social environiiietit in \\nwhich lie may find himself. Science is \\nusually thought of as organized (usable). \\nknowledge of the natural environment and \\nthe method by which that knowledge was \\nobtained and organized. Analysis of the \\nlatter feature leads to the conclusion that \\nit is nothing iiiore than that uncommon \\n“coiiiniodity,” coiiinion sense. \\nMr. Riddle has made out a good case for \\nthe value of the knowledge side of natural \\nscience in education. It would be inter- \\nesting to determine, if possible, what frac- \\ntion of adults who have “learned” science \\nin high school have experienced any educa- \\ntive change as a result of that learning. \\nFor example, what fraction having “passed” \\nbiology have developed an understanding \\nof life processes or modified their living \\nhabits as a result ; or, having passed phys- \\nics, have a real concept of the energy \\nchanges in an operating automobile with \\nresultant more intelligent driving. The \\nanswer to be expected would be probably, \\n“A very small fraction.” But are the ex- \\namples given biology and physics respec- \\ntively? Certainly they are not abstract \\nbiology and physics. They arc, however, \\nclassified, possible educative outconies and \\n 1098237x, 1937, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210408 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Many sicence \\nteachers apparently expect students to \\nreach these and similar ideas unconsciously. \\nMany articles during the past ten years \\nhave dealt with major generalizations of \\nscience to be obtained from science courses \\nby students. These, in many cases, have \\nbeen taught for niany times ten years hy \\ntexts and teachers without high educative \\neffect on the average student in general. \\nIn answer to the query, “Why?” the sug- \\ngestion is made that the student has ac- \\ncepted the statement usually as a desirable \\nbit of impersonal knowledge useful, if at \\nall, for examination purposes. This sug- \\ngestion must occur to anyone who has \\ntaught and intelligently observed average \\nstudents who generally seem interested in \\nknowing what the teacher wants tliein to \\nknow. The degree of knowledge will be \\ndetermined at test time. Hence the iiiiper- \\nsonal attitude of the average student of the \\naverage teacher. \\nIt is training \\nof a sort to lead to unquestioning accep- \\ntance of statements proposed as ideas by \\nassociates and involves no intelligence other \\nthan that iiivolved in memorization. If all \\ncourses in all departments are taught thus \\ncan we expect that, through schooling, we \\ncan educate for positive, intelligent social \\naction ? Habits develop through exercise \\nand here is no opportunity for exercise of \\nintelligence applied positively and produc- \\ntively. \\nAn implication of general unintelligence \\nis not to be gathered from the foregoing, \\nfor most individuals judge indicating intel- \\nligence but judge emotionally rather than \\nintelligently on a basis of proved ideas. \\nIn the classrooni it selcloni happens that a \\nstudent questions the validity of statements \\nmade by his teacher or textbook. One not- \\nable, depressing fact is the lessening of the \\nquestioning attitude among upper classes of \\nhigh school and college, implying a lessen- \\ning in activity of intetligencc with increas- \\ning exposure to academic contacts. This But this is not education. gives the idea that schools generally train \\nto attitudes of acceptance and contradicts \\nthe generally held concept of independent \\nAniericanisni. \\nIf the above conclusions are at all valid \\nthe obvious problem develops, “What, if \\nanything, can be done to develop an edu- \\ncative systeiii in tlie schools ?” One answer \\nis that education be directed toward usable \\nknowledge o C tlie environment through un- \\nderstanding of sources and relationships \\nbetween items of that usable knowledge. \\nHere is opportunity for use of the iiiethod \\nside of science directly or indirectly. Most \\nscience valuable to the average iiian in his \\nenvironnient is non-iiiatheniatical and phe- \\nnonienal. What he needs is an undei-stand- \\nstanding of causes and relationships of, \\nand between, phenomena, useful explana- \\ntions of those causes and relationships in \\norder that he may use them again in dif- \\nferent situations. But the way to learn \\nto explain is to explain again and again as \\none will need to explain. This leads to the \\nsuggestion that much of our scientific \\nknowledge be obtained scientifically. (It \\nmust be obvious that most textbooks of \\nscience as well as most textbooks are not \\nscientific in method of statement although \\nusually logical in organization.) This \\niiieans that the knowledge must be devel- \\noped not accepted, for science never accepts \\nblindly. In science teaching this will eliiii- \\ninate iinniediately niany topics usually in- \\ncluded in our courses and emphasize others. \\nThe incluctive approach to the solution of \\nproblems offers unexcelled opportunity for \\nthe creation, from the student’s viewpoint, \\nof genei-alizations. He arrives at thein \\nthroiigh his own thinking and they are his. \\nStudents thus reaching ideas are often sur- \\nprised to find they have learned, by their \\nown thinking, something whicli can be \\nfound in their textbook, as perhaps it orig- \\ninally reached the printed stage. This re- \\nquires no acceptance, no study of tlie teach- \\ner’s ideas; rather it gives a conception of \\nhow much atithentic knowledge has been \\nattained and an increasing tendency to \\n 1098237x, 1937, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210408 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

These are all \\ndesirable in other fields than science. \\nThe writer has found the use of objec- \\ntive questions for assigiied problems defi- \\nnitely helpful in learning with understand- \\ning and developing desirable attitudes. \\nTrue-False, Multiple-Choice, each choice \\nhaving some connection with the problem, \\nFact-Theory and Cause-Effect1 types may \\nbe used with the requirement that a scien- \\ntific validation of the conclusion made be \\ngiven. In arriving at a true choice the stu- \\ndent must have a clear understanding of \\nthe necessary principles. With insistence \\nupon validation of statements made on \\npaper and in class discussion an attitude \\ndemanding proof for ideas, including those \\npresented when necessary by the instruc- \\ntor, develops. Data exist to prove this \\nstatement. Evidence also exists of definite \\ncarry-over of this attitude into other de- \\npartments of instruction by the students and \\ninto their teaching by teachers in extension \\ncourses. \\nSome of the suggestions made here can \\nbe used in other fields than sicence teaching. \\nHowever science represents the field which \\ncan offer definite method and data most \\ncompletely.

J. Iilopp, Supervisor of Secondary Edu- \\nOtis W.

Science Teachers’ Association. \\nDelegate-Dr. Don 0. Eaird, Sam Houston \\nState Teachers, Huntsville, Texas. \\nThere are four very important problems to be \\ncarried out as far as possible during the present \\nyear. They are: \\n1. It is hoped that every individual member and \\nevery interested science teacher will see that the \\nquestion of affiliation of their local organizations \\nwith the A. S. T. A. is considered at the first \\nopportunity. It is expected that many of these \\norganizations all over the country will desire to \\naffiliate. All are invited. \\n2. We have several independent and very valu- \\nable journals for science teachers. However, it \\nseems as though none of these is able to meet ade- \\nquately all the needs of classroom teachers througli- \\nout the country. One objective of the A. S. T. A. \\nis to promote the development of either an existing \\njournal, or a new journal, which will more ade- \\nquately meet a larger number of needs. The only \\npractical way in which this can be done is to obtain \\na larger circulation. The A. S. T. A. will have \\na membership large enough to warrant the fre- \\nquent publication of a journal at a price within \\nready reach of every teacher’s pocketbook. Won’t \\nyou. therefore, canvass the situation among your \\nlocal teachers, and send in any comments pertinent \\nto this problem. \\n3. We have a complete trailscript of the meeting and discussions presented at Atlantic City. It is \\nhoped to make this available to every teacher who \\ndesires the same. If we have call for as many as \\nfivc hundred, we can supply them for about 456, \\nwhich includes cost of mailing. On the other hand, \\nif we can use a thousand or more, the cost will be \\nreduced to 306. Won’t you, therefore, fill out the \\nenclosed slip, indicating the number of copies that \\nyou and your associates would like at the 456 price, \\nand the number you would want if the price were \\n306. It would seem likely that we shall require \\nat least one thousand copies. However, we must \\nknow your wishes in the matter promptly. \\n4. According to the constitution, individuals are \\neligible to membership in the A. S. T. A. by the \\npayment of an annual fee of $1.00. On the other \\nhand, teachers who belong to affiliated organiza- \\ntions will have no individrral ~nemhership fee, in- \\nasmuch as their directorship fee of $5.00 per direc- \\ntor will entitle them to all privileges. This need \\nnot meaii, however, that members of affiliated \\norganizations may not join as individual members \\nas well. In which case, they should remit their \\n$1.00 to the treasurer. The money will, of course, \\nbe useful. Attached hereto is a slip which you \\nmay use for this purpose. \\nCordially yours, \\nHARRY A.

The \\nannounced program of papers and reports was \\ncarried out with the exception that Miss Myrtice \\nPledger, of the East Texas State Teachers Col- \\nlege, was unable to appear and present her paper. \\nThe treasurer’s report for the year indicated: \\nReceipts from all sources. , . . . . . . . . . . $146.32 \\nTotal expenditures . . . . . . . , . . . . . . . . . 114.77 \\nBalance on hand on February 17, 1937 31.55 \\nThe report of the business manager of NCES \\nNews Notes showed that the magazine had been \\npractically self-supporting during the year. The \\ntwenty dollars appropriated from the general funds \\nof the Council to News Notes had been used to in- \\ncrease the size of one issue from 16 to 24 pages. \\nA discussion of the advisability of allocating a \\ncertain fixed portion of the membership dues to \\nNews Notes in order that the magazine might be \\nimproved was opened by Mr. Whitman. It was \\nmoved by Mr. Wildman and seconded by Mr. \\nCarpenter that fifty cents of every dollar of mem- \\nbership dues be allocated to News Notes on a one- \\nyear trial basis. The motion was carried. \\nThe possibility of working out a plan of effective \\ncooperation between NCES News Notes and Sci- \\nence Education was suggested by Mr. Pieper. It \\nwas moved by Mr. Webb and seconded by Mr. \\nWildman that the executive committee of the \\nCouncil confer with Mr. Pieper during the year \\nconcerning the possibilities of cooperation and pre- \\nsent a report at the next annual meeting. \\nMr. Wildman, as chairman of the Publicity \\nCommittee, presented a program of seasonal activi- \\nties carried out in Philadelphia. He asked for the \\ncooperation of members of the council in working \\nout similar programs in other localities. \\nThe following report of the nominating commit- \\ntee was made by Mr. Robertson, one of the mem- \\nbers of the committee: \\nPresident, C. L. Thiele, Detroit Public Schools, \\nDetroit, Michigan. \\nVice-president, Harry A. Cunningham, Kent \\nState University, Kent, Ohio. Secretary-treasurer, Mildred Fahy, Pierce \\nIt was moved by Mr. Webb and seconded by Mr. \\nCurtis that the secretary be instructed to Cast a \\nunanimous ballot for the officers recommended \\nby the nominating committee. The motion was \\ncarried. \\nThe question of whether the National Council \\nshould continue to meet each year in the city \\nchosen as a meeting place by the Department of \\nSuperintendence was raised. The motion was \\nmade by Mr. Caldwell and seconded by Mr. Rob- \\nertson that the executive committee of the Council \\nconfer with the executive committee of the Na- \\ntional Association for Research in Science Teach- \\ning concerning the meeting place for next year. \\nThe motion was amended by Mr. Pieper to the \\neffect that the membership of the National Council \\nbe polled concerning the meeting place before any \\ndecision involving a change from the established \\npractice be reached. The motion, as amended, was \\ncarried. The meeting adjourned. School Chicago, Illinois. \\nHARRY A. CUNNINGHAM, \\nSecretary-Treasurer \\nCONFERENCE ON EDUCATIONAL \\nBROADCASTING \\nA release from the Executive Secretary \\nof the Second National Conference on \\nEducational Broadcasting, which will be \\nheld at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, No- \\nvember 29, 30, and December 1, 1937, indi- \\ncates the objectives, sponsors, and plans \\nof the conference. We quote certain sec- \\ntions of the release: \\nI. \\n11. \\n111. \\nIV. \\nV. The objectives of this conference, as formulated \\nTo provide a national forum where inter- by a committee, are as follows : \\nests- concerned with education by radio \\ncan come together to exchange ideas and \\nexperiences. \\nTo examine and appraise the situation in \\nAmerican broadcasting as a background \\nfor the consideration of its present and \\nfuture public service. \\nTo examine and appraise the listeners’ in- \\nterest in programs that come under the \\ngeneral classification of public service \\nbroadcasting. \\nTo examine the present and potential re- \\nsources of education through radio. \\nTo examine and appraise the interest of \\norganized education in broadcasting. \\n1 60 OCT., 19371 EDITORTATS AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS 161 \\nVI. To bring to a large and influential audi- \\nence the findings that may become avail- \\nable from studies and researches in the \\ngeneral field of educational broadcasting, \\nparticularly such studies and researches \\nas may be conducted by the Federal Radio \\nEducation Committee. \\nIn addition to the eighteen organizations which \\nsponsored the first Conference, the following have \\nbeen selected to sponsor the second, to increase the \\nscope of the social and cultural interests which will \\nbe represented on a nation-wide basis: American \\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, Amer- \\nican Association of University Women, American \\nFederation of Arts, American Library Association, \\nAmerican Public Health Association, Music Edu- \\ncators’ National Conference, National Council of \\nParent Education, National Federation of Music \\nClubs, and the National University Extension \\nAssociation. \\nThe American system of broadcasting, an evalu- \\nation of broadrasting from the point of view of the \\nlistener, educational broadcasting, and the future \\nof radio have been selected as the topics of the \\nfour general sessions. Speeches on these subjects \\nwill he made by prominent representatives of edu- \\ncation, the radio industry, and the listener, and \\nwill be followed by periods of open discussion. \\nEach afternoon will be devoted to section meet- \\nings in which specialists in the varioiis fields cov- \\nered in the general sessions will discuss specific \\naspects of each of these topics. At the banquet \\non the second evening, the speakers will discuss \\nthe international significance of radio. \\nRATINGS OF INSTRUCTIONAL \\nMATERIALS \\nWhile it is too early to judgc the value \\nof the plan for rating instructional mate- \\nrials inaugurated by Education Digest, our \\nreaders will be interested to follow the \\nevaluations of textbooks and courses of \\nstudy presented in recent and forthcoming \\nissues of the journal. The release con- \\ncerning the plan includes the following \\nstatements : \\nBecause the superabundance of instructional \\nmaterials makes it difficult for educators to choose \\nmaterials best suited to their needs, the editors of \\nthe Education Digest are seeking to help solve this \\nproblem by providing ratings on a five-point scale \\nfor various instructional items. The ratings are \\nmade by experts selected on a nation-wide basis. \\nThe textbooks, etc., are rated on content, work- \\nmanship, interest, teachability, and attractiveness. \\nAll fields of education from pre-school through \\nteacher-training are represented in the items rated. \\nSevcral psychological tests were rated for efficiency \\nin the September issue. U. S. GOVERNMENT \\nPUBLICATIONS \\nIn a letter of the Public Printer of the \\nU. S. Government Printing Office to the \\nChairman of the Joint Committee on \\nPrinting of the House of Representatives, \\nwhich is quoted in the Congressional \\nRecord (7218-147), one finds some inter- \\nesting inforiiiatioii on the extent of print- \\ning and circulation of governiiient publica- \\ntions. The Public Printer states that the \\ngeneral public should know that the Gov- \\nernment Printing Office operates a book \\nstore where 65,500 different publications \\nmay be procured at most reasonable cost. \\nDuring the fiscal year of 1937 the office sold \\n10,351,203 publications.

V. Church, is developing materials for \\nuse in discussion groups which are being \\norganized throughout the country to study \\ntrends and problems in secondary educa- \\ntion. A tentative series of approximately \\n150 questions have been prepared, bearing \\nupon Part I1 of the report of the Com- \\nmittee on Orientation of the Issues and \\nFunctions of Secondary Education. Part \\nI1 refers to Functions of Secondary Edu- \\ncation. \\nScience Teachers will be much interested \\nin the report of the committee and in the \\ndiscussion problems, particularly in view \\nof the fact that science has been given such \\na prominent place in the report. \\nIt is assumed that copies of the questions \\nfor discussion may be obtained from the \\nexecutive secretary, 5834 Kenbark Avenue, \\nChicago. A few of the questions are listed \\nbelow as illustrations. \\nWhat next steps toward a better program of inte- \\ngrating education in secondary schools are pos- \\nsible? \\nAre the common machines becoming so complex \\nthat the consumer must depend upon the service \\nprovided by the manufacturer and hence need know \\nvery little about them? \\nBy what means can the school most effectively \\nkeep the social values involved in higher individual \\nactivities constantly in the consciousness of all \\nlearners? Specifically how can this be done in \\neach of the special fields of learning, school train- \\ning, and experience now usually found in the high \\nschool? \\nFacing frankly the financial limitations that con- \\nfront most schools, what can you and your faculty \\ndo to make your records more useful for the \\nexploration and guidance of pupils? \\nHow may experimental procedures be designed \\nto clarify method and establish an organization so \\nthat basic laws and principles may be best under- \\nstood and applied? \\nWhat are the effects when pupils are required \\nor permitted to take subjects the values, immediate \\nor remote, of which they do not appreciate or be- \\nlieve in, subjects which they neither master nor \\nretain, and which they find no or few opportunities \\nto apply? How do you explain and justify the prescription of subjects which seem to youth of so \\nlittle value that they are dropped at the earliest \\npossible moment and are seldom if ever revived for \\nlater use of any kind? \\nCALIFORNIA COOPERATES IN \\nCONTINUOUS SCIENCE \\nPROGRAM \\nA report of the California Committee of \\nthe Department of Science Instruction of \\nthe National Education Association, dated \\nJanuary 19, 1937, contains the following \\nresolutions concerning a continuous pro- \\ngram of science instruction from kinder- \\ngarten to college : \\nWHEREAS, The successful functioning of a de- \\nmocracy depends upon the ability of its citizens to \\nthink clearly and participate freely in the solution \\nof the ever increasing social and economic prob- \\nlems ; \\nWHEREAS, The methods of science offer one of \\nthe best ways through which a citizen may be \\nguided to the truth in making his decisions ; \\nWHEREAS, The task of cultivating scientific atti- \\ntudes, such as, open mindedness, suspended judg- \\nment, willingness to change opinion on the basis \\nof new evidence, search for the whole truth re- \\ngardless of personal prejudice, the habit of basing \\njudgment on the facts, is a most difficult task abso- \\nlutely necessitating an extension of training time \\nover the lives of pupils for successful accom- \\nplishment. \\nTherefore, We, the members of the Department \\nof Science Instruction of the National Education \\nAssociation for the State of California, recommend \\nthat boards of education provide for the necessary \\nexperimental procedure for the ultimate working \\nout of a continuous program of science instruction \\nfrom kindergarten to college. \\nUnder date of June 11, 1937, there ap- \\npears a second report prepared by the \\nchairman of the committee which states \\nthat the Committee will support the plan \\nfor a two-year study of such a continuous \\nprogram for the country at large, in af- \\nfiliation with the Department of Science In- \\nstruction. The work of the first year will \\nbe devoted to a survey of the best thought \\nand practices at the present time. The \\ncommittee plans to devote the second year \\nto a serious consideration and evaluation \\nof all recommendations received during the \\nfirst year. \\n 1098237x, 1937, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730210311 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

His \\nconcern was mainly with the first six years \\nbut it might easily be extended to the junior \\nhigh school. In several mimeographed \\nlists Mr. McSpadden suggested how a \\nbody of useful equipment may be built up, \\nsome at little expense, some at no expense, \\nto “form a science corner or laboratory \\nwithin the classroom.” Children’s toys are \\nquite a valuable source. Miss Wheatley \\nfollowed with demonstrations of work done \\nby children in the foi-m of notebooks, draw- \\nings, compositions, sculpturing, scrapbooks, \\netc. \\nMr. John Brown brought the point of \\nview of a student from a technical college, \\nwishing for closer coordination between \\nhis learning and his living. Miss Hartig, \\nwhose experiences at New College were in- \\n200 Apm~, 19381 EDITORIALS AND EDUCA.TIONAL NEWS 201 \\nteresting foundation for her remarks, con- \\ntrasted her viewpoint with that of the pre- \\nceding speaker. \\nMiss Hartig stated that in the prepara- \\ntion for work in education in New College, \\nemphasis is placed upon the individual and \\nthe development of a curriculum directed \\ntowards his needs. Opportunity is provided \\nfor self-directed activity and independent \\nstudy. The student’s real curriculum is \\nrecognized to be the sum total of all his ex- \\nperiences, including many which take place \\noutside the school. \\nThe work in natural science at New Col- \\nlege, in classroom and outside the class- \\nroom, is directed toward: \\n1. Awakening in students a keen awareness \\nand importance of science technology and the \\nscientific method. \\n2. Developing an intelligent understanding \\nand thorough articulateness concerning these \\nprinciples and generalizations of science which \\nare functional in the habits of thought and action \\nof liberally educated members of society. \\n3. Providing the student with knowledge and \\nskills needed in teaching science. \\nIn the classroom of a newly developed \\nbiology course, offered for the first time \\nthis year at New College, one finds that \\nthere is very little presented in the way of \\norganized lectures, which many colleges \\nseem to consider of essential importance to \\nthe students. \\nAll of the instruction centers around \\nhelping the students solve some particular \\nproblem which is individually interesting to \\nhim. There is no prescribed body of sub- \\nject matter that must be covered in any \\ngiven period of time and students are free \\nto make use of the laboratory facilities pro- \\nvided at any time during the week. The \\nclass hours which are definitely set, are used \\nmainly for discussion of problems which \\nhave arisen during the course of the week‘s \\nwork and for advice and guidance which \\nwill be useful in the solution of these prob- \\nlems. \\nIf problem solving is to be considered \\none of the techniques essential to intelli- \\ngent participation in modern life, it seems \\nthat there can be no course of study more valuable than one which gives the learner \\nan opportunity to learn problem solving by \\nworking out his own individual problems. \\nFrom a student’s viewpoint this working \\nout of individual problems requires the op- \\nportunity, time and equipment for individ- \\nual work as well as the wise conselling of \\nexperienced adults. As a student my plea \\nto all you who are attempting to improve \\nscience instruction is to recognize us as in- \\ndividuals and not nebulous aggregates of \\nquestionable protoplasm and to provide \\nindividual experience which will aid us as \\nindividuals in making satisfactoiy. and \\nsatisfying adjustment to our environment \\nand to our fellow beings. Would not both \\nteachers and students function more intelli- \\ngently if they could only work cooperatively \\nin promoting the general welfare through \\nthe recognition and solution of problems \\nreal to us as individuals and valuable to us \\nas interdependent members of sociey ? \\nTar. Williard‘s demonstrations in ele- \\nmentary physics for non-college pupils in \\nhigh school probably stirred a responsive \\nchctrd in those instructors who are asked to \\ndeal more and more with certain adoles- \\ncents, largely unknown in the public sec- \\nondary school a few years ago, now in high \\nschool in increasing numbers. Mr. Wil- \\nliar d demonstrated simplifications of Archi- \\nmedes’ Principle with applications to ex- \\nperiences of boys and girls. “These \\nexperiences I present as attempts on my \\npa1 t to explain the pupil’s environment, not \\nin terms of abstruse technical accuracy, but \\nin such familiar and homely phrase and \\nproof as are compatible with his limited \\nability and mode of life.” His mimeo- \\ngra.phed sheets of a variety of simplified \\nexperiments were available to members and \\nvisitors. \\nAfter a short period for examining the \\nmaterials on display the reports turned to \\nforeign countries. Dr. Alexander Efron \\nreported on science classroom activities in \\nFrance and Russia based on a seven-month \\nresident study made by the author. \\n“In spite of political upheavals and a \\n 1098237x, 1938, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730220411 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

French \\nsecondary education remains today among \\nthe most rigidly fixed and traditionally \\nstable systems on the continent.” \\nDr. Efron* traced the aims, selective \\ncharacter, and curriculum of the secondary \\nschool (lycee and collcge) in its seven \\nyear program. In more detail he described \\nthe logical expository presentation of phys- \\nics and chemistry. He described methods \\nof teacher training in France with its in- \\nsistence on subject matter but meagre pro- \\nf essional preparation. \\n“Present day Soviet education reflects \\nRussia’s new political social and economic \\norder.” Seven and ten year secondary \\nschools follow the primary level, and lead \\nto the university level. Both “complex \\nplan” and Dalton plan have disappeared to \\nbe followed by “stable school programs, \\nstable and standard textbooks, formal tests \\nand examinations.” . . . The Soviet sec- \\nondary school now aims very definitely at a \\ngeneral education, while retaining its poly- \\ntechnical aspect as an instrument for chang- \\ning the old social order.” \\nBoth chemistry and physics are required \\nsubjects with considerable emphasis placed \\non laboratory work, excursions in industrial \\nplants and museums. As in France, the \\nsubject matter is approximately equivalent \\nto our first year liberal arts courses. Train- \\ning of teachers in service is a pressing prob- \\nlem in Russia. Combined with the course \\nof study in science is the “use of materials \\nof Socialist Reconstruction discussion of \\nchemical warfare and self-defense, and the \\nstudy of Five-Year Plans.” \\nMr. Powerst spoke on persistent life \\nproblems in science education. \\nNew College Community is a branch of \\nNew College of Teachers College, Colum- \\nbia University, devoted to training of teach- \\ners on an undergraduate level. “The chief \\npurpose of New College Community is to \\nprovide an experience in intimate group \\n* Editor’s note.-Mr. Efron’s paper was pub- \\nlished in the March issue of this journal. t Editor’s note.-The paper by Mr. Powers \\nis published in this issue. living in a rural environment, and at the \\nsame time abundant opportunities for in- \\nstruction in the natural sciences are avail- \\nable.” \\nMr. Powers described the equipment of \\nthe 80-acre farm and explained that “the \\nproblems of existence are faced by the staff \\nand students as a group.” “Instruction in \\nthe natural sciences enters chiefly into the \\nproblems relating to the control of the nat- \\nural environment and the achievement and \\nmaintenance of good health.” The speaker \\nstated a number of the units of instruc- \\ntion, major objectives, and described in \\nsome detail the building and up-keep of the \\nhydroelectric plant. He discussed the ac- \\ntivities associated with the learning of \\nprinciples and at attempt at testing when a \\nprinciple has been learned. The relation of \\nthe New College Community to the larger \\ncommunity becomes a vital part of the \\nprogram and presents opportunities for \\nwork in the social sciences as well as in \\ngeology, biology, and physics. \\n“There are certainly many difficulties as- \\nsociated with carrying out a teaching tech- \\nnique of this type; but we believe it offers \\na vital basis for giving instruction which \\nadds to the interest of the students and \\nenables them to learn more effectively.” \\nMr. Carpenter traced the history of the \\nuse of radio in Rochester schools, begin- \\nning as an emergency in the seventh year \\norganization and continuing because of \\ndemonstrated value. He cited some of the \\nproblems and methods and explained the \\nrelationship of the radio lessons to the \\nclassroom activities. Mr. Carpenter read \\nsome of the fan mail showing the reactions \\nof his listeners. These letters indicate “in- \\nterest and thoughtfulness.” Some are \\nmoved to break forth in rhyme. Attention \\nwas called to “the importance of the listen- \\ning parents” who “for the first time may \\ntruly participate in the educational experi- \\nences of their children.” Another value of \\nthe radio broadcasting is to the teacher in \\nservice, who becomes familiar with the \\nmethods and objectives, and who may be \\nstimulated to further study. \\n 1098237x, 1938, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730220411 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

These studies, which were lim- \\nited to special science subjects, made it clear \\nthat there is needed a comprehensive inves- \\ntigation which shall include all the major \\nsciences used for general education. \\nDuring the meetings of the A.A.A.S. at \\nIndianapolis, December 27, 1937, to Janu- \\nary 1, 1938, the Executive Committee and \\nCouncil passed the following resolution : \\n“The Council voted to direct its standing \\nCommittee on the Place of Science in Edu- \\ncation to represent the Association in the \\norganization of plans for the evaluation \\nand improvement of the teaching of science \\nin colleges.” \\nA Committee, that is representative of \\nthe sciences now offered in the colleges as \\na part of general education, is to be or- \\nganized. The individual members will be \\nselected from among those college teachers \\nwho are known for their scientific achieve- \\nments and for their interest in improving \\nteaching. Tentatively, the Committee is \\nknown as the Committee on Improvement \\nof Science in General Education. \\nThe work suggested to the Committee on \\nImprovement of Science in General Edu- \\ncation is roughly outlined in the following \\nsections of this memorandum. It is un- \\nderstood that this Committee, when or- \\nganized, shall further define its purposes \\nand procedures, and shall be responsible \\nfor the supervision and conduct of its work. \\nConstructive suggestions are welcomed \\nfrom any source. \\nPROPOSED FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE \\nON IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENCE IN \\nGENERAL EDUCATION \\nGeneral: To initiate, encourage, guide, \\nand support studies designed to explore, \\nevaluate, and improve the teaching of the \\nsciences as a part of general education. Specific: 1. To clarify and define the \\nproblems involved in teaching the sciences \\nas a part of the program of general educa- \\ntion. \\n2. To develop a more scientific attack \\nupon problems of science teaching ; that is, \\nto promote experimentation ; to collect evi- \\ndence, to encourage the use of procedures \\njustified on the basis of organized and \\nevaluated evidence in contrast to opinions, \\nuntested assumptions, and uncritical ac- \\nceptance of traditional practices. \\n3. To disseminate information about the \\nCommittee’s work, and to secure construc- \\ntive criticism by means of discussion \\ngroups in college and university centers, by \\nparticipation in programs, and by such \\nother means as may be found effective. \\n4. To obtain and to use financial support \\nfor such work in the sciences as gives \\npromise of being effective in improving the \\nteaching of science in general education. \\n5. To serve as a clearing house for coor- \\ndinating the activities of the several agen- \\ncies now working on parts of the whole \\nproblem, and now agencies which may be \\ninitiated for the improvement of science \\nteaching. \\nMeetings of available members of the \\nCommittee on the Place of Science in Edu- \\ncation were held in Indianapolis on Decem- \\nber 30 and 31, 1937. A third meeting was \\nheld in Washington, D. C., February 20, \\n1938. Also, correspondence between com- \\nmittee members has helped to formulate \\nthis memorandum. The following state- \\nments as guides have been formulated : \\n1. The Committee on Improvement of \\nScience in General Education should in- \\nclude outstanding scientists and college \\nteachers who have a deep interest in gen- \\neral education, who have had successful ex- \\nperience with science at various levels, and \\nwho are able and willing to devote consid- \\nerable though and effort to the project. \\n2. The Committee on the Place of Sci- \\nence in Education should undertake to \\nlearn who are regarded as probably useful \\nmembers of the proposed new committee. \\n 1098237x, 1938, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730220411 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

There \\nwas unanimous agreement that “one of the \\ngreatest handicaps to the promotion of un- \\nderstanding between different peoples and \\nraces lies in differences of language.” \\nIf the words, “teachers” and “educators” \\nwere substituted for “peoples” and “races” \\nin the above quotation, it would be a suit- \\nable theme for a science teachers confer- \\nence. Of course sophisticated modern stu- \\ndents of education refer facetiously to new \\ntermiriology as “patter” and with the con- \\ntempt of familiarity ornament their con- \\nversation with newly learned words. Out- \\nside of the classic halls also, when a new \\nword strikes the popular fancy it gains \\nmeaning as a rolling snowball gains size. \\nThe present irritant is “integration.” In \\ncalculus, this had, we recall (perhaps \\nvaguely) a well-defined meaning. But the \\njoining of 2 and 3 to make 5 was still called \\naddition even though the dictionary defi- \\nnition, “bringing together parts into a \\nwhole,” could logically have been applied \\nto such a process. Since the transfer of \\nthe term from mathematics to education, \\nintegration has been applied to the whole \\nschool system, as in Virginia; to the cor- \\nrelation and coordination of two subject \\nfields, as English and science ; to the organ- \\nization of the curriculum in any school \\nabout socially important problems ; to the \\norganization of the field of science about \\nsimilar problems; to the fusion of two or \\nmore science subjects, as physics and chem- \\nistry ; to comprehensive examinations COV- \\nering more than one field and to any asso- \\nciation of experiences in the learning \\nprocess. Altogether a confusion of \\ntongues. The CoIlege Entrance Board says in its \\nDefinition of Requirements (1936), “The \\nexamination in physical sciences will be \\nbased upon a two-year integrated course in \\nphysics and chemistry, and in biological \\nsciences upon an integrated course in the \\nbiological sciences which will test the stu- \\ndent’s ability in and grasp of not only \\nbiological principles but also the physical \\nand chemical fundamentals.” The Thirty- \\nfirst Yearbook (page 16) speaks of “inte- \\ngration of subjects of study,” and in an- \\nother place (page 60) says, ‘(Learning takes \\nplace as a process of integration of the \\nideas that are products of real experi- \\nence.” \\nThus we have the term, integration, tak- \\ning over the functions of such terms as, \\narticulation, correlation, fusion, coordina- \\ntion, organization, center of interest, asso- \\nciation of ideas, and others. It is applied \\nwith equal ease to the learning process, ‘the \\ncurriculum, special fields of study, indi- \\nvidual subjects, or to combinations of sub- \\njects or examinations. \\nEfforts by educational agencies are be- \\ning made to vitalize instruction and to make \\nthe principles learned in school function in \\nout-of-school life. In all of these plans it \\nseems to be assumed that learning is inte- \\ngration of experiences. If this is accept- \\nable usage, why not adopt it. Can we \\nagree that integration shall mean, “the \\nbringing together” of experiences so that \\nlarger meanings and understandings are \\nbuilt up? The ((whole” which results will \\nbe the individual whose “integrated experi- \\nences” enable him to interpret his world \\nand to solve his problems. The so-called \\nintergration of subject matter will not of \\nitself result in the integration of the in- \\ndividual life. It is not so simple. Em- \\nphasis on inquiry instead of memorization \\nmay help ; reorganization of courses about \\n93 94 SCIENCE EDUCATION [ V~L. 22, NO. 2 \\nprinciples rather than about factual head- \\nings may help; motivation by, and applica- \\ntion to, problems of daily out-of-school life \\nmay help; deletion from our science courses \\nof obsolete and non-functional material \\nmay help. But no remedy for the present \\nill of our science instruction will prove to \\nbe a panacea just because it bears the label, \\n“integration.” \\nP.S.-It might be a worthwhile project \\nfor a representative committee to under- \\ntake the annual publication, in representa- \\ntive educational journals, of good usage in \\neducational terminology. \\nRALPH E.

ANNOUNCEMENT-WITH APOLOGIES \\nIn the January issue we began a new \\nsection of the journal, entitled “Digests of \\nUnpublished Investigations.” Dr. Francis \\nD. Curtis has agreed to prepare for each \\nissue one or more of these digests of un- \\npublished doctoral dissertations relating to \\nthe field of science education. We are \\nindeed happy to announce this new feature \\nof the journal and are delighted to have \\nthe digests provided for publication by one \\nso well qualified as Dr. Curtis has proved \\nhimself to be in this capacity. Most of our \\nreaders are acquainted with the two vol- \\numes of digests prepared by Dr. Curtis in \\nyears past. \\nOur deepest apologies are offered to Dr. \\nCurtis and to our readers for neglecting to \\nmake this announcement in the January \\nissue. The Editor’s illness and his ab- \\nsence from the office are the reasons for \\nthe oniission. We beg forgiveness. \\nADVANCED PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN \\nLOS ANGELES \\nOur readers are acquainted with the \\nmovement which, in an increasing number \\nof schools, is directed to the substitution of \\nan advanced course in physical science for \\nthe separate, special courses in chemistry \\nand physics for students not expecting to \\ngo to college or not expecting to offer credit \\nin one of the special sciences as a prereq- \\nuisite in technical and professional cur- \\nricula following their high-school work. \\nMore positively stated these new courses \\nare designed to serve the purposes of gen- \\neral education at the secondary level. \\nThose concerned with this movement will \\nexamine with interest and profit Publication \\nC-136 by the Los Angeles City School \\nDistrict, under date of September, 1937. \\nThe mimeographed bulletin of 55 pages \\nis entitled “Advanced Physical Science- \\nA Laboratory Science for Upper Grades- \\nTeachers’ Guide.” The general plan for \\nthe course is presented in the first ten \\npages; detailed suggestions for each of the \\nten areas of investigation in the course are \\n 1098237x, 1938, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730220213 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

It \\nis not to be considered as a finished product, \\nbut rather as an aid to furthering and expand- \\ning the program that has developed to date. \\nEvidence at hand indicates that this type of \\nstudy offers considerable promise in meeting the \\nneeds of a large group of senior high school \\npupils of the city. The course is representative \\nof the functional emphasis which is pervading all \\nphases of the senior high school curriculum. \\nIt is a recognition of the great need for pro- \\nviding materials and problems which will chal- \\nlenge the abilities and interests of pupils and \\nwhich will thereby give them a truer under- \\nstanding of the scientific world of today. \\nThe ten areas of investigation outlined \\nhave the following headings: Water, The \\nEarth, The Atmosphere, Astronomy, Fuels, \\nLight, Transportation, Communication, \\nMaterials and Processes, Household Equip- \\nment. In each area one finds suggestions for problems dealing with various aspects \\nof the area, a list of major understandings \\nsought, a list of scientific principles, and \\nreferences to books and periodicals. \\nIt has been some time since there has ap- \\npeared a document in this field which shows \\nso broad a view of the place of physical \\nscience in the secondary curriculum, and \\nsuch a carefully prepared approach to the \\ndifferent areas of the course. More work \\nof this kind will go far in the challenge \\nof the place of separate courses in physics \\nand chemistry for the secondary school \\nwhich have objectives in harmony with \\nacceptable objectives of general education. \\nWhether or not the course as outlined will \\nsucceed in its stated purposes will depend \\nupon the individual pupil and class activ- \\nities which are really the course for the \\npupil. A later edition of the outline in the \\nform of suggested observations, experi- \\nments, demonstrations, field trips, and \\nother physical and mental activities for the \\nlearner would not only be welcomed by a \\nlarge number of science teachers, but would \\nat the same time give a better indication of \\nthe probable success of the course as out- \\nlined. \\n 1098237x, 1938, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730220213 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

It was voted to \\nrefer the matter back to Mr. Noll, the \\nsponsor, for a budget and for further in- \\nstructions to the Committee. The Secre- \\ntary was instructed to so notify Mr. Noll. After considerable discussion regarding \\nthe establishment of a policy of publishing \\nYearbooks of the Association and the con- \\nsideration of possible areas which might be \\nfruitful for such study, it was decided to \\nbegin on such a yearbook and that its sub- \\nject should pertain to innovations in several \\nareas of science teaching related to the \\nupper levels of science teaching, specifically \\ngrades 1@-14. It was moved, seconded and \\nvoted that the Publications Committee be \\ninstructed to solicit articles, both from the \\nmembership and from outside, on innova- \\ntions in the following aspects of science \\nteaching as related to the upper levels of the \\nsecondary school : \\n(1) Educational Values, (2) Objec- \\ntives, (3) Materials, (4) Teacher Edu- \\ncation, (5) Vocational Aspects of Sci- \\nence, (6) Survey Courses, and (7), \\nsuch other aspects as may seem appro- \\npriate. These articles will be pub- \\nlished in SCIENCE EDUCATION and sub- \\nsequently bound as a Yearbook of the \\nAssociation. \\nThe names of Mr. A. N. Zechial and Mr. \\nLouis M. Heil were voted by the Executive \\nCommittee and the Secretary was instructed \\nto conduct the usual poll. \\nThe new President, Mr. Powers, was in- \\nstructed to investigate the possibility of co- \\noperative work with other organizations, \\nsuch as the American Association of School \\nAdministrations, in the production of year- \\nbooks. \\nIt was moved that E.

The chief cause of this trend is the \\ni apid and bewildering development ill the \\napplication of science to huinan needs. \\nThis development affects our ethical, sociat \\nand political life profoundly. \\nIf we are to prepare our students for \\nfuture citizenship, or even for their present \\nlives, we must give them an understanding \\nof the effects of science on modern living. \\nIt is not enough to teach them that the \\ntrlephone uses an electromagnet or that \\nchlorine is used to purify water. \\nWe are not preparing our students to \\nmake intelligent adjustments in a world \\ngrowing more complex each day. The \\npresent approach in teaching and course \\nconstruction seems to have as its premise \\nthat all of our students are preparing for \\nscientific callings in life, whereas only a \\nsmall percentage is doing so. The result \\nis a tremendous waste of time for the \\nothers. \\nNot long ago all high school art pupils \\nwere painfully drilled in rules of perspec- \\ntive and drawing. Little was said about \\nwhere art and life meet. Art educators \\nsoon realized the futility of attempting to \\nmake producers of art out of everyone in \\nschool, regardless of aptitude or desire to \\nproduce art. It was realized that it is \\nmore important to educate for the appreci- \\nation and consumption of art, because that \\nis what most of the students will be doing \\nas adults. Teachers of art, therefore, \\nbegan to stress the significance of art in \\nthe conirnunity, such as in public parks and \\nbuildings ; in the home : furniture, draper- \\nies and clothes; in the theater: costumes, \\nsettings, and make-up ; and in advertising. \\nSculpture, architecture, the graphic arts. the biography of artists and the develop- \\ninent of art were incorporated in courses. \\nsuch an approach meets to-day’s needs \\nbetter than merely drawing baskets of fruit \\nand vases. \\nA close analogy exists in science educa- \\ntion. We are attempting to make pro- \\nducers of science out of the students who \\ncome to us. Itegardless of aptitude, in- \\nclination, or ueed, we put them through the \\nsame routine. Studies show that students \\nforget most of the facts they meet in \\nscience courses a short time after they have \\ncompleted the course. In too many cases \\nthe motivation is mainly a desire to finish \\na subject so as not to be annoyed with it \\nany longer. \\nYet, there is great need for intelligent \\nappreciation of science and consumer sci- \\nence. Power dams, railroads, steamships, \\nairplanes, mines, mills, food processing, \\ntelegraphs, telephones, radios. x-ray, sur- \\ngery, medicine, dentistry, housing. heating, \\nlighting, refrigeration, air-conditioning, \\ntextiles, printing, sky, earth and water will \\nimpinge in some way on the present and \\nlater life of the pupil. \\nNo one of our great scientists is ex- \\npected to kiiow all these fields from a pro- \\nducer standpoint, but as future citizens and \\nconsumers, our students should and can be \\ntaught their significance in modern life. \\nThe rapid changes in materials, devices, \\naid services is leaving the public inore in \\nignorance each day. A calloused populace \\nknows only to push buttons and to expect \\nmiracles, yet sensitive curiosity concerning \\nseasons for happenings is one of the im- \\nportant scientific attitudes. \\nScience stressing informational recall \\nhas not prevented a stupendous annual \\nwaste in human and wild life, timber and \\nsoil. The iinplications of communication, \\ntransportation and power are oblivious to 262 [VOL. 22, No. 5 \\nmost science students. Are we training for \\ncitizenship ? \\nThe problem of finding a job will face \\nalmost every one of our pupils a short time \\nafter he leaves school, yet what awareness \\nhas lie of thc wide range of producing and \\nconsuming activities going on ? \\nScientific attitude, democratic citizen- \\nship, and vocational guidance are highly \\ndesirable ohjectives. If science appreci- \\nation and consuiiier science appear better \\nccjuippcd to achieve them, then the next \\nmovements in curriculum revision slioultl \\nGe clear. \\n~VILLIAM REINER \\nNCZCJ ITtvrcht High Schod \\nRi~ookly12, N.

By general agreement, it \\nwas decided to consider the report, item \\nby item. \\nItem I. The N.A.R.S.T. should take an \\nactive and leading role in stimulating re- \\nsearch and publishing summaries of re- \\nsearch on practical problems of science \\nteaching. (See attached report for sub- \\ndivisions.) This item was adopted upon \\nmotion by Mr. Robertson, duly seconded. \\nThe Association should adopt \\na change from formal programs of axinria1 \\nmeetings except during the dinner meeting. \\n(See attached report for sub-divisions.) Item. 11. \\nDiscussion : \\nMr. Eilzenberry-Is not sure that the \\nproposal will work because of the confu- \\nsion. \\nMr. Powers-There will be a Program \\nCommittee which might canvass the field \\nfor papers and research. \\nMr. Noll-The Program Committee \\nwould arrange fofmal parts of program. \\nThe Coordinating Committee would ar- \\nrange the program proposed in Item 11. \\nMr. Cahooir-Proposed a transition type \\nof program leading from the present into \\nthe newer plan. \\nMr. Noll-Arrangements might he made \\nin a hotel for committee rooms. This \\nwould provide the physical set-up for the \\nprogram. The newer program is not \\nmandatory, therefore, no transition period \\nneeded. It might be tried for a year or \\nMr. Heiss-Proposed program too rigid. \\nThere should be a plan for open meetings \\nand for presentation of outside research \\npapers. In favor of adopting Mr. Cahoon’s \\nproposal of a transition period. \\nMr. Anibal-It is desirable to continue \\nthe cooperation with other outside groups \\nthrough joint meetings. \\nMY. Curtis-Puzzled by the new pro- \\nposal. There appears to be a degree of \\nregimentation. It may not be practicable Willing to try it out. \\ntwo. to organize the entire membership into \\ncommittees because of the diversity of in- \\nterest. Who will assign members to the \\nconimittees ? \\nhlr. Powers-Project plan as if in op- \\neration during the current meetings. \\nMr. NoZZ-The Coordinating Cornmit- \\ntee would make assignments to coninlittees \\nafter considering the wishes of each nieni- \\nber. In agreement with Mr. Anibal that \\ncooperation with other organizations should \\nbe continued. \\nMr. Robertson-Offers an objection to \\nmeeting devoted to coininittee reports be- \\ncause of the impossibility of getting many \\nreports in. \\nMr. Haviglzurst-There would probably \\nnot be more than five committees. Fifteen \\nor twenty minutes might be given €or each \\nreport. If a report was in final form, more \\ntime might be devoted to it. \\nMr. Powers-It would be tlie function \\nof the Coordinating Committee to assign \\nand plan for time. \\nMr. Croxton-How much research could \\nbe done by these committees in two days? \\nOr is the purpose to stimulate, review, \\nevaluate and coordinate research ? \\nMr. NoZZ-The object is to provide \\ntime, not now available, for committees to \\nwork. Research done or studied might be \\npresented. \\nMr. Powers-Would it help in Item I1 \\nto insert after the word, “program,” the \\nidea that this has reference primarily to the \\nfore-noon programs of Monday and Tues- \\nday of the present procedure? \\nMr. Hnvighwst-In answer to Mr. \\nCroxton’s question. Committees would \\nnot necessarily conduct research. They \\nmight or perhaps they would be evaluating \\nand assembling research. They might be \\npreparing tests and devices during the \\nyear. Such a committee might eventually \\nreach the point where a report was desir- \\nable. It might then use committee time in \\nplanning the report or in writing it. \\nMY.

We \\nshould permit other people to come in on \\nsuch a plan. \\nMY. NoZZ-The researches, progress and \\ndeliberations of the committees would be \\npresented in open meetings. \\nMr. Powers-Suggests two half-day \\nperiods for such a plan as called for in \\nItem 11. \\nMu. NoZl--At least three half-day \\nperiods should be set aside, one to be used \\nfor reporting. \\nMr. Obourrz-Called attention to the \\npossibility of using Sunday afternoon as a \\ntime for committee meetings. \\nMr. Presto%-For those not interested \\nin research we should provide one meeting \\nfor hearing outside papers. One meeting \\nshould also be provided for cooperation \\nwith other groups of the A.A.S.A. \\nMr. Powers-The committee meetings \\nshould be open meetings. \\nMr. Watkins-It all seems a question of \\ntime. We must provide time for commit- \\ntee meetings and deliberations. \\nMr. Craig-Suggests that the Coordi- \\nnating Committee be left to the Executive \\nCommittee during the next year and give \\ntime for the Executive Committee to take \\nnecessary steps. We still need a program \\ncommittee. \\nMr. Huvighirrst-The Program Com- \\nmittee have at least one meeting for report- \\ning research. Moved the adoption of Item \\nI1 with the understanding that the Pro- \\ngram Committee arrange as much time as \\npossible for the working committees but that there should be at least one meeting \\nopen to contributed papers. The motion \\nwas seconded. Discussion : . \\nMr. Wathzs-This is only tentative and \\nmay be rescinded at any future time. \\nMr .

Four hundred prints repre- \\nsenting all sections of tlie United States \\nwere exhibited at the Salon last spring. \\nUnder tlie supervision of a coinniittee \\nrepresenting The Institute and the Camera \\nClubs in many large scliools, the Salon is \\nconducted on the same basis as are the \\ngreat professional shows. Only those pic- \\ntures which, in the opinion of the judges, \\nmeet tlie standard of technical and artistic \\nskill will be admitted for exhibition. Awards will be made by a judging com- \\nmittee of professional experts, and there is \\nthe strong likelihood that prize winning \\nprints will find their way to the World’s \\nFair in 1940. \\nMembers of camera clubs everywhere \\nand junior and senior high school students \\ninterested in good photography are urged \\nto write The American Institute, 60 East \\n42nd Street, New York City, for the Salon \\nbooklet which gives information, rules and \\nan entry blank.

Toricelli, Newton, Priest- \\nley: Lavoisior, Faraday, Tyndall, Darwin, \\nLister, Pasteur and all of our modern \\nscientists are bringing us out into the white \\nlight of scientific truth. With these shin- \\ning esamples of truth for truth’s sake \\nbefore us, what shall Be the kind of science \\nwe shall teach our boys and girls today \\nand tomorrow ? \\nFew boys and girls of our secondary \\nschools will enter the fields of pure science \\nthrough the doors of our technical schools. \\nMost will step directly into the work-alday \\nworld to fight the battles of existence. \\nWhat kind of science should be taught \\nthese boys and girls? What kind of sci- \\nence were you taught? What kind of \\nscience are your children being taught \\ntoday? Is it the kind of science you want \\nthem taught? Is it the kind that inspired \\nGalileo, Darwin, Lister and Pasteur and \\nmade them apostles of truth and right liv- \\ning? If this is not the kind of science they \\nare being taught they are not getting what \\nthey ought to have. They are entitled to a \\nscience which motivates them to want to \\ndevelop right methods of thinking, a whole- \\nsome attitude to the problems and a fuII \\nappreciation of the verities of life. \\nThe content of general science, biology, physics and chemistry and allied sciences \\nlends itself admirably to the attainment of \\nthese ends in the hands of expert and wise \\nand right-minded teachers. These sciences \\nwill, when properly handled, open the eyes \\nof our youth to the wonders and mysteries \\nof Nature, reveal the romance of the com- \\nmonplace, and set before them the ideals of \\ntruth and discipline as life guides. Such \\nwas the science of Galileo and Pasteur. \\nSucli is the science of Compton, Jeans, \\nMillikan and Einstein. \\nEvery new science text is stuffed full of \\nfacts. But what about principles? What \\nabout the proper methods of thinking \\nabout these facts and principles ? Hardly \\na text in any science today gives 25 per \\ncent of its pages to discussion of principles. \\nAgain we may ask: What shall be the con- \\ntent of the science teaching of tomorrow? \\nThe answer may well be: It will be coni- \\nposed of facts but only enough facts to \\nmake it possible to understand principles \\nbased upon these facts. \\nTo illustrate. The observations and ex- \\nperiments of Galileo involved a method. \\nThere is a best method of doing anything, \\neven washing dishes or cultivating a gar- \\nden. And that best method is the scientific \\nmethod. Old stuff we may retort. Yes, \\nbut is it? For the sake of simplicity we \\nmay say that this iiiethod is the solution of \\nany problem in a logical and commonsense \\nmanner. We all ilse this method iniper- \\nfectly. The boy who makes a kite or the \\ngirl who bakes a cake faces a problem and \\nmust use a method to solve it. Success or \\nfailure depends upon the understanding of \\nthe problem and the thoroughness with \\nwhich its steps are carried out. A success- \\nful solution encourages to greater effort. \\nA failure brings discouragement and loss \\nof further effort. \\nThe science of tomorrow will stress this \\nprocess of scientific thinking and the uni- \\nversal use of the experimental method. \\nSteps in the process of solving problems \\nwill not be overlooked.

It will train our boys and girls to \\nrecognize consciously each step and then \\nmake them so skilled in their use that they \\nwill be followed unconsciously in the solu- \\ntion of everyday problems. Youth will \\nmake fewer errors, register many more \\nsuccesses. These should make for greater \\nhappiness and contentment. \\nThen again, the science of tomorrow \\nwill place much less stress upon text-books \\nand more emphasis upon the things that \\nthe text or the immediate situation sug- \\ngests as worth doing. Processes of thought \\nwill be set up which will take critical note \\nof every step in experimental work. A re- \\nflective turn of mind will be developed. \\nReflective thinking and dissociation of ideas \\nwill be the chief method of mind activity. \\nEmbryonic criminals may take thought for \\nthe morrow. Such books as “100,000,000 \\nGuinea Pigs will have few sales, good as \\nthey are. Patent medicine companies and \\nquacks will go out of business. \\nReflective thinking \\nwill prevent boys and girls from coming \\nto half-baked conclusions. Healthy and \\nsane discussions regarding the truth or \\nfalsity of hear-say, tale-bearing and propa- \\nganda of every sort will be developed. \\nBetter reflective thinking will sharpen \\njudgment and steer millions from gold \\nbricks, watered stocks, get-rich-quick \\nschemes, chain letters, fortune tellers, lot- \\ntery gambles, sweepstakes, and chewing \\nthe bitter cud of reflection. \\nStill again, the science of tomorrow will \\nlead our youth to keep their minds open \\nto the truth. It should also encourage the \\ndevelopment of a tolerant attitude towards \\nthe opinions of others who are honestly \\nseeking the truth. This attitude has char- \\nacterized our greatest scientists and made \\nthem almost without exception reverent \\nmen. \\nAnd finally, the science of tomorrow \\nwill stress the importance of the recogni- \\ntion of the truth and the significance of the And this is not all. law of cause and effect. Every cause has \\nits effect and every effect its cause. Once \\nthis great concept lays hold of the minds \\nof our youth, common superstitions, so \\nprevalent even among people who ought to \\nknow better, will be a thing of the past. \\nCommon sense sees no relation between \\nwalking under a ladder and bad luck or \\nbetween finding a horseshoe and good luck. \\nScience rules both out of our minds. Yet \\nbecause we have had insufficient training \\nin the scientific method too many people \\nhave a sneaking suspicion that there must \\nbe something in it. \\nAnd what shall the final outcomes of the \\nteaching of the science of tomorrow be? \\nSimply this: Each man and wonian it is \\nhoped will have developed a sound philoso- \\nphy of life that will carry him or her \\nthrough the thick and thin, through the \\nhappiness and despair of a victorious life. \\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that so many \\npeople today place too little confidence in \\nthe efficacy of religious beliefs. Why not \\nlet science be their religion? Since both \\ntheologians and scientists seek the truth, \\nthe scientific method of thinking will lead \\nboth nearer the truth. Both will recognize \\nuniversal law which is as immutable as the \\nstars in their courses and which implies an \\nIntelligence that can make natural laws \\nand enforce them. This philosophy of life \\nwill drive out fear and will encourage the \\nindividual to conserve his own life and the \\nlife of others. \\nThis kind of science of tomorrow must \\nbe for all the people if the mental life of \\nall our people is to be kept sane, sweet and \\nwholesome. And it will be the Science of \\nTomorrow if the search after truth is re- \\nlentlessly followed by our best teachers of \\nscience. This kind of a search has harnied \\nno man and is the promise of the World \\nof Tomorrow. \\nGEORGE C.

The Chair- \\nnzan, F. D. Curtis, responded with the fol- \\nlowing report : “In order to be classed as a research investiga- \\ntion a reported study must satisfy the criteria in \\none of two categories (a) the experimental and \\nstatistical studies and (b) the analytical and non- \\nstatistical studies. \\nExperimental studies are characterized by the \\nfollowing steps of technique : \\n1. A carefully and specifically defined and \\ndelimited problem. \\n2. An exhaustive examination of the literature \\nappertaining to the problem. \\n3. The collection of data and their treatment \\nby appropriate statistical techniques. \\n4. A statement of the conclusions which seem \\njustified by the findings. \\nA~alyti~d sttidies are characterized by the fol- \\nlowing steps of technique: \\n1. A carefully and specifically defined and \\ndelimited problem. \\n2. An exhaustive examination tf the literature \\nappertaining to the problem. \\n3. A technique appropriate to the problem and \\nalso one that provides defensible means by which \\nthe validity and the reliability of analysis may be \\ndetermined and maintained. \\n4. A statement of the conclusions that seem \\njustified by the findings. \\nIt is obvious that these two types of research \\nare not mutually exclusive in all respects. Analy- \\nsis often enters into studies that are primarily \\nstatistical ; such elementary phases of statistics as \\nnumerical tabulations and computations of per- \\ncentages or correlations may appropriately be a \\npart of the technique of an analytical study. \\nAn analysis, however, which presents only the \\nresults of the investigator’s judgment unchecked \\nby the judgments of others applying the sole \\ntechnique and criteria, is not, according to this \\nreport, a research investigation.” \\nIn the discussion that followed, Mr. \\nGlenn pointed out that this report should \\nbe placed in the official minutes to protect \\nthe organization and also to serve as a \\npartial guide for judging the competency of \\npersons proposed for membership in the \\norganization. Mr. Brown suggested that \\nthe Committee should add several brief \\nexamples of research of different types to \\nits report. Mr. Bedell suggested that the \\nreport might be published in a prominent \\nplace in SCIENCE EDUCATION and that criti- \\ncisms be requested. He further pointed \\nout the importance of this definition as a \\nguide to those training graduate students. \\nMr. Zechiel questioned the applicability of \\nthe types of research defined by the com- \\nmittee to areas such as were defined in \\n“Science in General Education.” His fear \\n 1098237x, 1940, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730240414 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Caldwell. These were written in \\nappreciation of his long service of science educa- \\ntion, and were in recognition of his seventieth \\nbirthday. The presentation was made in an elo- \\nquent tribute by Dr. J. McKeen Cattell, and the \\nresponse of Dr. Caldwell was heartfelt. \\nAt the business meeting the following officers \\nwere elected for 1940: \\nPresident, Harry A. Cunningham, Kent State \\nUniversity, Kent, Ohio. \\nFirst Vice-president, Homer W. LeSourd, \\nMilton Academy, Milton, Mass. \\nSecond Vice-president, Ralph K.

Mitchell, Dansville Central \\nHigh School, Dansville, N. Y. \\nThe report of the Constitution Kevisien \\nCommittee was not given in the absence of \\nMr. Powers, the chairman. \\nA report of the editor of SCIENCE EDU- \\nCATION, Mr. Pieper, was read by the Sec- \\nretary. Mr. Pruitt, Business Manager of \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION, reported that the \\nfinancial condition of the journal was satis- \\nfactory and probably as good as it had \\nbeen at any time. \\nMr. Davis moved that the reports on \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION be adopted and that \\na committee be appointed to form a reso- \\nlution of appreciation to Mr. Pieper and \\nto Mr. Pruitt for the excellent work which \\nthey have done on the magazine. Mr. No11 \\nseconded the motion which was voted. Mr. \\nCurtis was requested to present the reso- \\nlutions at the Tuesday morning Business \\nMeeting. \\nThe following report was next presented by Mr. Noll, Chairman of the Coordinating \\nCommittee : \\n“Following the Cleveland meeting of the \\nN.A.R.S.T., in 1939, a Coordinating Committee \\nwas appointed, consisting of Messrs. Craig, \\nCurtis and Noll. The term of office was deter- \\nmined by lot, and the results were: Noll, one \\nyear; Curtis, two years; Craig, three years. \\nNo11 was elected chairman for the ensuing year. \\nIn October, 1939, a questionnaire was sent to \\nall the members of the Association inviting them \\nto express their preferences as to the field of \\nresearch in which they would care to work. A \\nnumber of possible areas were suggested, and \\nprovision was made for additions. The returns \\nof the questionnaire were quite satisfactory, \\nalthough a substantial number indicated that they \\nwould not be able to attend the St. Louis meeting. \\nOn the basis of these returns five working com- \\nmittees were organized to work in the areas of \\nCurriculum, Methods, Evaluation, Teacher Train- \\ning and Audio-visual Materials, respectively. The \\nmembership was distributed to these five com- \\nmittees in accordance with individual preferences \\nprimarily; but also with a view to expected \\nattendance at the St. Louis meeting, and a proper \\nbalance in size of committees. Each member was \\nnotified by mail of his appointment to a committee. \\nOne member of each committee was selected \\nas temporary chairman. This person was in- \\nvited to accept this responsibility, and all agreed \\nto do so. Each temporary chairman was mailed \\na list of the members of his committee. \\nThe Coordinating Committee attempted to \\norganize the Association Committees in such a \\nway that there would be no delay in the short \\ntime available at St. Louis in getting the com- \\nmittees to work. It was suggested to the tem- \\nporary chairmen that they get in touch with mem- \\nbers of their respective committees and make any \\npreliminary arrangements they deemed necessary. \\nThe committees met for the first time on Mon- \\nday morning, February 26, in St. Louis, and pro- \\nceeded to elect a chairman and a secretary. Fol- \\nlowing this they outlined a program of work for \\nthe coming year. \\nThe committees met again on Thursday morn- \\ning, February 27, and the members of the Science \\nCommittees of the National Education Associa- \\ntion were invited to meet with our committees at \\nthis time. Plans were completed for the year’s \\nwork, and reports were made. Because of small \\nattendance, the Committee on Audio-visual Aids \\ndid not meet. However, the Coordinating Com- \\nmittee feels that this phase of the work should \\nnot be neglected. \\nThe Coordinating Committee met in St. Louis \\nand elected Mr. Curtis as Chairman for the \\ncoming year.” \\nE.

Science Committee. Mr. Will \\nRurnett of Teachers College, Columbia \\nUniversity, presented a detailed report of \\nthe work of Teacher Training Committee. \\nThis material is available if you will write \\nto Mr. Burnett. \\nAn interesting discussion followed. \\nThe Secretary presented a summary of \\nthe deliberations of the Executive Commit- \\ntee at its Monday afternoon meeting. \\nThe Committee appointed at the Sunday \\nevening meeting, prepared an expression \\nof appreciation to Mr. Pieper and Mr. \\nPruitt for their excellent work on SCIENCE \\nEDUCATION. This was read by the Secre- \\ntary. It was moved and seconded that the \\nresolution be adopted. \\nThe Secretary was instructed to see that \\nthese resolutions be sent. \\nMr. Hurd raised the question of funds \\navailable for the work of the Association \\nCommittees. The Secretary requested that \\nexcept for small expenditures for postage \\nand mimeographing, a budget be prepared \\nand sent to the Secretary for the reaction \\nof the Executive Committee. \\nFollowing are the reports submitted by \\nthe chairmen of some of the Association \\ncommittees : \\nThe report of the Evaluation Committee \\nwas presented by Mr. Bedell as follows : \\nEvaluation represents a basic area of science \\neducation in which the membership of the \\nN.A.R.S.T. can be of material assistance to all \\nteachers and research workers in science teach- \\ning. The Association’s activities in this area \\nshould recognize the work being done by other \\norganizations, and so far as possible our efforts \\nshould be directed toward evaluation activities \\nnot being attempted by others or toward an im- \\nproved refinement of the accomplishments of \\nothers. While your committee recognizes the \\nfinancial limitations under which work must be \\naccomplished, it also is aware of the tremendous \\nresources of ideas and experience within the \\nN.A.R.S.T. membership. We, therefore, invite \\nthe cooperation of all members as well as non- \\nmembers in the successful completion of the \\nfollowing projects : 1. Summarizing the progress and accomplish- \\nment reports of the several groups now attacking \\nthe problem of evaluation in science education. \\nIt is hoped that these summaries will be of suffi- \\ncient value to merit publication in SCIENCE EDU- \\nCATION so that everyone interested may be aware \\nof the progress being made by others. Reports \\nof any evaluation group of which you are a mem- \\nber will be welcomed by the Committee. \\n2. The preparation of lists of specific objec- \\ntives which should be the outcomes of science \\nunderstandings, skills, and attitudes. Your com- \\nmittee feels that the early publication of such a \\nlist would be of utmost worth to all those now \\nengaged in evaluation. We hear much of scien- \\ntific thinking and scientific attitudes; but the need \\nnow is for more specific things which characterize \\nthese important objectives. Noll’s analysis of \\nscientific attitudes and Tyler’s analysis of scien- \\ntific thinking represent steps in this direction. \\nSuch behaviors as inferring generalizations from \\nspecific facts, the identification of data which sup- \\nport a given generalization as compared with data \\nwhich do not, the ability to hold a suspended \\njudgment when data are insufficient, the willing- \\nness to determine experimentally conclusions \\nwhich are not supported by evidence, illustrate \\nsome of the more specific aspects of scientific \\nthinking and scientific attitudes. Your commit- \\ntee is desirous of having exhaustive lists of \\nspecific objectives which provide an analysis of \\nall of the more general objectives commonly \\nascribed to science education. Suggested grade \\nlevels for which these specific objectives may be \\nappropriate are important. \\n3. The preparation of test items appropriate \\nfor the measurement of various kinds of specific \\nobjectives. While paper-pencil items are of great \\nimportance, the word test is here used in the \\nbroader sense to denote various kinds of behavior \\nas well. Pupil performances, both individual and \\ngroup, laboratory situations, anecdotal behavior \\n01’ any other kind of specific behavior which \\ncharacterizes science learnings are significant \\ntools for science evaluation. Grade levels for \\nwhich the various test and behavior items may be \\nappropriate are important. \\n4. The preparation of a list of evaluation in- \\nstruments. Your committee has considered paper- \\npencil tests, anecdotal records, interviews, per- \\nformances, and group projects. Suggestions on \\nadditional instruments and refinements of the \\nabove will be welcomed by your committee. \\n5. The preparation of a list of areas of science \\nevaluation. Your committee has considered \\nknowledge, skills, attitudes, study techniques, \\nproblem solving techniques, and social responsi- \\nbilities. Suggestions on other areas are invited. \\nYour suggestions on any of the above points \\nwill determine the extent to which your committee \\ncan function adequately. All material sent in \\nwill be examined carefully, and full credit given \\nfor that which is used in the publications and \\nreports of the committee.

After pre- \\nliminary forms are submitted to all committee \\nmembers, final forms are to be prepared and used \\nto collect desirable data from both undergradu- \\nates and teaching graduates. Each cooperating \\ncommittee member was to be encouraged to feel \\nfree to supplement the data in any manner which \\nseemed feasible. \\nThe committee decided to ask for an expense \\nallowance from the Association treasury and to \\nsubmit a synthesized report to all members well \\nin advance of the next annual meeting of the \\nAssociatian, so as to make intelligent discussion \\npossible at that time. \\nIt was understood by the committee that, even- \\ntually, a combined committee report would be \\npublished in the Association Journal. \\nPhillip Johnson presented the following \\nreport for the Committee on Methods : \\n“The sub-committee on Methods was called to \\norder by P. M. Bail, the temporary chairman. \\nThe following members were present : Bail, \\nCahoon, Jean, Johnson, Thiele and Wood. The \\ngroup decided to discuss the general problem of \\nmethods before selecting a permanent chairman \\nand secretary. \\nAspects of methods which were discussed by \\nthe committee may be stated as follows: \\na. How can we teach pupils to define problems? \\nb. How can we teach pupils to gather data? \\nc. How can we teach pupils to evaluate data \\nand draw conclusions? \\nd. How can we teach pupils to work coopera- \\ntively in the solution of problems? \\ne. How can we teach pupils to apply what they \\nlearn? \\nf. How can we teach pupils to assume individ- \\nual responsibility for learning? \\ng. How can we teach pupils to engage in com- \\nmunity betterment projects? \\nh. How can the effectiveness of various \\nmethods be evaluated? \\ni. What should the sub-committee adopt as a \\nframe of reference for their deliberations? \\nAfter considerable discussion it was decided \\nthat the sub-committee should initiate and carry \\nthrough some type of service project which may \\nnot necessarily qualify for research.

In its quest for truth it is mor- \\nally neutral and ideally honest. It is no \\nrespecter of race, creed nor faction as long \\nas it is science. It drives toward its goal \\nwithout emotion and without regard for \\nthe social or political consequences of its \\nfindings. This impartial truth seeking \\nspirit of science causes dictator nations to \\nfear it, and causes more democratic forms \\nof government at times to circumvent it. \\nThis objective nature of science also in- \\nduces well meaning individuals occasion- \\nally to make harsh statements concerning \\nit. But science must forever continue in \\nthis way, for, any attempt on the part of \\nvested interests or of constituted author- \\nity to restrict the freedom of science to \\npursue its impartial course would close \\nthe way to truth in a degree commensurate \\nwith the success of that attempt. \\nThe spirit of science and the spirit of \\ngenuine democracy sprang from the same \\nvintage, namely, the inherent urge of men \\nto be free. These began to manifest them- \\nselves in human affairs at about the same \\ntime and have maintained a syinbiotic \\npartnership ever since. They must stand \\nor fall together. \\nTo safeguard this truth seeking spirit \\nof science and to secure the benefits of its \\nfindings to all the people is to insure the \\nperpetuity of the democratic way of life. \\nIn this endeavor science education has a \\npart to play. Said Alexander Meiklejohn \\nin his treatise on philosophy, “The more \\nmen accomplish the greater is their need \\nfor understanding what they are doing. \\nAnd if this is true then the present time is \\none of very great need.” Science education \\nrecognizes this need and definitely con- cerns itself with the social \\nsequences of the findings and moral con- \\nof science. It \\nis concerned with promoting a wiser use \\nof the power the method of science has \\ndelivered into our hands. Above all it \\nseeks to induce an attitude of intellectual \\nhonesty in dealing with the prohleiiis that \\nbeset human society. \\nIn practice, science education assumes \\nas a working basis the following hypothesis : \\nThe disorders that infest the world at the \\npresent moment are traceable to the selfish \\nand unwise management of the power that \\nthe method of science has delivered to a \\nscientifically unprepared world. The tech- \\nnological mode of society that man has \\ncreated through the method of science sud- \\ndenly induced power exploitation of the \\nworld’s resources. This has made it easy \\nfor individuals, groups of individuals and \\nwhole nations to disguise selfishness and \\nto induce a unilateral flow of opportunity \\nwith subsequent social and economic crisis. \\nWe are now in the midst of such a crisis \\non a world scale. \\nAttempts to deal with these conditions \\nin a democratic way can meet with but \\nlittle success with a public that is untrained \\nin the truth seeking method of science (the \\nhand-maid of democracy). Likewise it \\ncan meet with little success in a public \\nunaware of the basic interdependencies \\nthat actuate the world and a public that \\nlacks an understanding of the forces that \\nthe method of science has revealed and ren- \\ndered available to us. \\nScience education seeks, therefore, to \\nassist in producing a generation of lay \\nconservationists or lay directors of the \\npower which science has made available ; \\na generation with at least a layman’s in- \\nsight into the meaning of the forces that \\nare constantly transforming and disturbing \\n393 394 SCIENCE EDGCATION [Vor.. 24, No. 7 \\nour social and economic life so that democ- \\nracy may cease to be frustrated through \\nselfish and unwise use of that power. \\nWe believe this can best be achieved by \\na continuous process of growth from early \\nchildhood.

Webb was published in the \\nNovember, 1940, issue of The Peabody \\nJournal of Education. This list is now \\navailable in reprint form at the postpaid \\nprice of fifteen cents. The compiler de- \\nscribes the present list as follows : \\nThese titles will satisfy almost every desire \\nfor a type of enriched reading in science. \\nHerein is practicality-much that will help in \\nthe intensive courses of mechanics, aviation, \\nand other practical arts. Herein is drama; \\nthe adventure books this season are particu- \\nlarly thrilling. Herein is the poetry of nature, \\nespecially in gardens ; herein is an unusual \\namount of fun in sports and games. \\nAs in previous lists, the author gives \\nhis own suggestions for the purchase of \\nreference books, grouping them in various \\nprice groups. Textbooks are paced in a \\nseparate list and carry no price groupings. \\nThe “library” represents one more valuable \\nservice to the teaching of science by the \\nEditor of Current Science. All science \\nteachers are indebted again to Mr. Webb. \\n 1098237x, 1940, 7, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730240712 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The November, 1940, issue \\nof School Life carries a complete state- \\nment of agreement on these functions by \\nthe Federal Administrator of the National \\nYouth Administration, The United States \\nCommissioner of Education, and a group \\nof chief State school officers and State \\ndirectors of vocational education. Eight \\nspecific articles of agreement are stated in \\nline with the clearly defined and mutually \\nexclusive functions of the two agencies. \\nSpace does not permit our giving in full \\nthese statements. However, a general \\nstatement of principle is here quoted : \\nBriefly, then, the function of the United \\nStates Office of Education is to secure the \\ndevelopment and operation of educational or \\ntraining programs for all youth, and the func- \\ntion of the National Youth Administration is to organize and administer programs of work \\nfor needy or selected youth. \\nACTIVITIES IN EDUCATION AND RECREATION \\nThe Works Projects Administration in \\nPhiladelphia has issued a report of its \\nactivities in education and recreation, spon- \\nsored by the Board of Public Education of \\nPhiladelphia. The report, entitled For All \\nthe People, describes the nature and variety \\nof services rendered, the groups and the \\nindividuals who plan and carry out the \\nactivities, and the contribution to democ- \\nracy of the program.

Approxi- \\nmately 500 accredited junior colleges are \\nnow found in the United States besides \\nanother hundred which are not yet thus \\nrecognized. \\nAbout two-thirds of the 175,000 students \\nenrolled in these institutions do not con- \\ntinue their formal education after leaving \\nthe junior college. The new study will be \\nconcerned particularly with courses and \\ncurricula of a semi-professional and cul- \\ntural character designed to give this in- \\ncreasing body of young people greater eco- \\nnomic competence and civic responsibility. \\nThere is increasing evidence that existing \\nfour-year colleges and universities are not \\norganized adequately to meet the needs of \\na large part of this significant group. \\nIt is anticipated that the exploratory \\nstudy will reveal the need and the oppor- \\ntunity for a series of additional studies and \\nexperimental investigations and demonstra- \\ntions which may cover several years of \\ncontinuous effort. \\nThe new study will include a large pro- \\nportion of the junior colleges in the United \\nStates. It will be sponsored by a nation- \\nwide representative committee. \\nImmediate responsibility for the study \\nwill be vested in an executive committee \\nconsisting of Rosco C. Ingalls, Chairman, \\nDoak S. Campbell, and Byron S. Hollings- \\nhead. The Director of the study will be \\nWalter Crosby Eells, Executive Secretary \\nof the American Association of Junior Col- \\nleges, Washington, D. C. SUMMER CONFERENCE OF THE NEW \\nENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF \\nCHEMISTRY TEACHERS \\nThe first Summer Conference, held last \\nAugust at the University of Vermont, was \\nso successful that the Executive Cotnmit- \\ntee of the New England Association of \\nChemistry Teachers has voted to hold a \\nsecond conference this summer. The meet- \\nings will be held on the campus of thtx Uni- \\nversity of Maine on August 13, 14, 15, and \\n16, 1940. The morning and afternoon ses- \\nsions will be devoted to topics of current \\ninterest pertaining to the teaching of chem- \\nistry in secondary schools and colleges and \\nrecent advances in scientific knowledge. \\nSpeakers of national reputation will par- \\nticipate. Meals and lodging will be pro- \\nvided at a very low rate by the University, \\nand accommodations for families will be \\navailable. A social program, taking advan- \\ntage of the location of the conference at one \\nof the country\\'s foremost vacation spots, is \\nbeing planned. \\nThe Committee in Charge is comprised \\nof the following: Dr. Lawrence H. \\nAmundsen,. of the University of Coniiecti- \\ncut ; Prof. hvery Ashdown, of the Massa- \\nchusetts Institute of Technology ; Prof. \\nCharles A. Brautlecht, of the University of \\nMaine; Mr. Roscoe Dake, of Phillips \\nAcademy; Mr. Standish Deake, of Milton \\nAcademy ; Mr. Everett F. Learnard, of \\nNorwood Senior High School; Miss Eva \\nRuggli, of the Cambridge Latin School; \\nand Mr. \\'Theodore C. Sargent, of Swamp- \\nscott High School, Chairman. The follow- \\ning officers of the association are also serv- \\ning ex-oficio : Mr. Ralph E. Keirstead, of \\nWethersfield High School, President ; \\nProf. Laurence S.

Known as Model PG- \\n170, the projector was designed specificalfy \\nfor use among schools and by industrial \\nusers of 16 mm. films. \\nDeveloped by the same RCA Photo- \\nphone engineers who have designed 35 mm. \\nsound motion picture equipment now in use \\nin production studios and theaters, this pro- \\njector nieets the exacting requirements of \\ntheatrical projection at moderate cost. The \\nprice is $300. \\nSimplified in construction to provide ex- \\nceptional ease of operation, the new RCA \\nprojector has many features which are \\nespecially interesting to schools. These \\ninclude : \\nUnusually brilliant projection with a \\nstandard 750-watt lamp ; RCA Photophone \\nsound with push-pull amplification-10- \\nwatt output ; simplified threading with \\nthreading line on projector casting ; the- \\natrical framing-no change of projector \\nposition ; efficient cooling of projection \\nlamp. The lamp itself is quickly changed \\nand the lamphouse remains cool after long \\noperation. \\nThe machine’s sound reproduction is accomplished with RCA stabilized sound, \\nwith the sound drum mounted on shielded \\nballbearings ; shockproof stabilizer between \\ntake-up reel and sound drum; rigidly \\nmounted and easily accessible sound optical \\nsystem ; and an electro-dynamic speaker \\nmounted in separate case. The output of \\nlife-like sound is sufficient for any class- \\nroom or the average school auditorium. \\nOne of the interesting features of the new \\nRCA projector is the separate motor for \\nfilm take-up and rewind. This eliminates \\nentirely the use of exterior belts and is \\ninstantly adjustable to provide proper ten- \\nsion for 400, 800, 1200 or l6OO-foot reels. \\nOther features include one-point lubri- \\ncation of high speed parts-all journals are \\npermanently lubricated ; sound and silent \\nfilm projection speeds with governor-con- \\ntrolled motor ; easy cleaning of aperture \\ngates ; provision for using microphone for \\npublic address or to explain either silent or \\nsound films during projection ; connection \\nfor record players using either crystal or \\nniagnetic pickup ; variable tone control ; \\nand extreme portability of projector (39 \\nIbs.) and speaker (20 Ibs.), both cased in \\nattractive and durable black fabrikoid. \\nTHE AMERICAN INSTITUTE \\nPUBLICATIONS \\nScience teachers in the field will be inter- \\nested in the following announcement from \\nthis organization which, as a non-profit \\nagency of public education in science, has \\nbeen of great service in New York City. \\nThe American Institute is not in the publication \\nfield on a competitive basis. It wishes to \\nannounce two of its publications: The Scien;e \\nLeaflet and The Science Observer. The subscrip- \\ntion rate on the Leaflet is $2.00 per year; on the \\nObserver, fifty cents a year. If both publications \\nare subscribed for the following rates apply: the \\nObserver, 35 cents, and the Leaflet, $1.80. \\nTHE AUDUBON NATURE CAMP \\nA unique camp whose purpose is the \\npromotion of conservation through special \\ntraining of teachers, youth leaders and \\n 1098237x, 1940, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730240214 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The hooks are \\nprepared in the l3ureau of Educational Ke- \\nsearch in Science at Teachers College, \\nColumbia University, by a group of expert5 \\nin the various fields of science in collahora- \\ntion with constiltants in education, school \\nadministration, and evaluation. \\n47 48 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 24, No. 1 \\nThe establishment of the Bureau in 1935 \\nwas authorized by the Dean of Teachers \\nCollege and was made financially possible \\nby a grant from the General Education \\nBoard. Associated with it are several co- \\noperating schools where materials are \\ntested in actual practice, and froin which \\nreports on experiences of many kinds are \\nobtained. \\nThe point of view underlying the work \\nin the Bureau takes account of a demo- \\ncratic conception of human life and society, \\nof the extraordinarily rapid changes in en- \\nvironment which modern science is bring- \\ning about, and of a conception of human \\ncapabilities as adequate to cope with these \\nchanges. \\nMaterial in the basic science volumes \\nbears upon problems and issues of modern \\nliving and is arranged so as to serve the \\nfunctional needs of students and adults \\ntoday. Books now available in this group \\nare Life and Enviroiiineiit by Paul B. \\nSears, of Oberlin College, The Storehouse \\nof Civilbnkioiz by C. C. Furnas, of Yale \\nUniversity, and The Control of Organisms \\nby F. I,. Fitzpatrick, of Teachers College. \\nProfessor Sears offers an ecological ap- \\nproach to the study of environment and \\nfurnishes basic content for theory and prac- \\ntice in conservation. Professor Furnas \\ndiscusses our natural resources from the \\nstandpoint of more effective production and \\ndistribution of goods and services with the \\naid of science and technology. Man’s \\nprogress in making conditions favorable for \\nthe organisms he finds useful and unfavor- \\nable for those he finds harmful is the theme \\nof Professor Fitzpatrick’s book. Other volumes in this basic science group \\nwill deal with the development of our ideas \\nconcerning the physical world, genetic na- \\nture of man, scientific attitudes, evolution, \\nthe social character of human nature, and \\nthe human life span. \\nOf the monographs on teaching sugges- \\ntions, there is availahle Suggestioiis for \\nTeachiptg Sflected Material froin thc Field \\nof Genetics by Anita D. Laton, of the \\nBureau of Educational Research in Science. \\nand Edna W. Bailey, of the University of \\nCalifornia. The material is intended to be \\nof assistance to teachers in their classrooms. \\nIt includes a resume of the knowledge in \\nthe field and its relation to social problems, \\nsuggested activities for students, and means \\nof evaluation. \\nThe second monograph, .Selected Ma- \\nterial from the Field of Sex Responsive- \\nness, Mntiizg, and Reprodiictioiz by Dr. \\nLaton and Professor Bailey, is ready for \\nthe press. It follows the same outline and \\ncontains the same kinds of material as \\nGenetics. \\nOther Suggestions for Teaclzing now in \\npreparation deal with life and environment, \\nphysiological exchange of material and \\nenergy, life span, scientific method, origin \\nof concepts concerning changes in the mo- \\ntions of bodies, evolution, technological \\nutilization of energy. \\nSamuel Ralph Powers, of Teachers Col- \\nlege, is administrative officer of the Bureau \\nof Educational Research in Science and \\neditor of the series, which is published by \\nthe Bureau of Publications, Teachers Col- \\nlege, Columbia University. \\n 1098237x, 1940, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730240112 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

TRAVEL FIELD COURSE \\nDuring the summer session of the School \\nof Education of Western Reserve Univer- \\nsity, a field course is offered for teachers. \\nThe course is designed to give teachers \\nbackground and firsthand information on \\nsuch subjects as forests, grasslands, alpine \\nregions, glaciers, gold mining, -the fishing \\nindustry, and lumbering, etc. Emphasis is \\ngiven to the ecology of the areas visited. \\nTeachers will have an opportunity to gain \\nconcrete experiences in certain areas of \\nnatural science. \\nThe itinerary includes such national \\nparks as Zion, Bryce, Grand Canyon, U. S. \\nGrant, Sequoia, Mount Rainier, and \\nGlacier. Other points of interest will be \\nSalt Lake City, California, Portland, and \\nSeattle. From Seattle the itinerary in- \\ncludes an Alaska cruise with stops at such \\nfirests as Ketichekan, Juneau, Seward, \\nand the new Metanuska colony. \\nThe air-conditioned Pullman and the \\ndelightful sailing in the Alaska waters help \\nto make the field cruise both educational \\nand recreational. Those wishing informa- \\ntion concerning the field course may write \\nto Ellis C. Persing, Western Reserve Uni- \\nversity, Cleveland, Ohio. \\nCONSUMER EDUCATION CONFERENCE \\nA regional conference on consumer edu- \\ncation will be held on the campus of George \\nPeabody College for Teachers on Friday \\nand Saturday, May 17 and 18, 1940. The \\nmajor themes include a consideration of \\nbasic questions in consumer education and \\ncurrent practice in consumer education. \\nThere will be two general sessions which \\nwill include addresses by John Cassels, In- \\nstitute for Consumer Education, Stephens \\nCollege, Columbia, Missouri ; Edna J.

The members of the panels \\nwill include outstanding leaders in their \\nrespective fields of consumer education. \\nSince this is the first conference of its \\nkind in the southeastern region, a repre- \\nsentative gathering of teachers and others \\ninterested in consumer education is ex- \\npected. The conference is being conducted \\nin cooperation with the Institute for Con- \\nsumer Education at Stephens College. \\nAUDIO-VISUAL SCHOOL AIDS \\nThe 1940 edition of “ Audio-Visual Serv- \\nice for Schools,” a widely-read presenta- \\ntion of sound products and services de- \\nveloped especially for educational use, has \\nbeen announced by Ellsworth C. Dent, Di- \\nrector of the RCA I’ictor Educational \\nDepartment. Presenting radio and related equipment \\nof a wide variety, the booklet is being dis- \\ntributed to thousands of educators through- \\nout the country, and may be obtained with- \\nout cost from Rlr. Dent’s office at Camden, \\nNew Jersey . \\nEquipment designed to aid classroom in- \\nstruction and extracurricular activities, as \\nwell as general administrative problems, is \\nillustrated arid described. Emphasis is \\nplaced on practical applications, rather than \\non lengthy technical descriptions of the \\nequipment. New radio and Victrola in- \\nstruments, instantaneous recorders, sound \\namplification systems, two complete sound \\nsystems providing radio and Victrola re- \\nproduction, and a new l6-1n111. sound \\nmotion picture projector are shown. \\n“Audio-visual Service” opens with a \\nbrief history of IiCA Victor’s 30 year \\nbackground in bringing schools the bene- \\nfits of recorded aids to instruction. It is \\npointed out that recent advances in elec- \\ntronic engineering have placed at the dis- \\nposal of schools a vast number of additional \\nteaching aids. Accordingly, brief informa- \\ntion concerning laboratory and test equip- \\nment and U.H.F. (ultra-high-frequency ) \\nbroadcast and receiving equipment is \\nincluded. \\nJUNIOR COILEGE hfOVEMENT \\nEnrollment in junior colleges in the \\nUnited States has doubled in the last seven \\nyears, according to the 1940 Junior College \\nDirectory, just issued by the American \\nAssociation of Junior Colleges. \\nEnrollment has increased froin 155,588 \\nto 196,510 in the last year.

In a large system \\nwhere it is practically impossible for the \\nsupervisor to personally visit each science \\ndepartment as often as he should, it enables \\nhim to be familiar with problems that \\nwould otherwise escape his notice. \\nThe clinic idea is based on the assump- \\ntion that if a medical clinic is a place where \\npeople with physical problems may go, \\npresent their problems and with the help \\nof a group of experts, solve them or, at \\nleast, approach their solution, then a science \\n(or any other field) clinic should be a \\nplace where science teachers may go, pre- \\nsent problems encountered in the teaching \\nof science and with the help of a group of \\nexperts, in this case teachers themselves, \\nsolve these problems or approach their \\nsolution. A clinical group should be kept \\nunder thirty members, otherwise it becomes \\nunwieldy and defeats the purpose of the \\nconference. In a large system one teacher \\nfrom each school is sufficient. \\nAt the start of a clinical conference, the \\nleader (who may be the supervisor) ex- \\nplains the “clinic” idea. He urges them \\nto refrain from speeches and debates while \\nparticipating, in order to conserve time. \\nFollowing is a brief account of a clinic \\nheld in general science : \\nAfter a brief introduction the members \\nof the group were invited to present their \\nproblems, one at a time, which were listed \\non the board. When all problems were listed, problems of a siinilar nature were \\ngrouped together, thus cutting down the \\nnumber. Then the problems were thrown \\nback to the group, one at a time, by the \\nleader for solution. In other words, the \\ncollective thinking of a group of teachers \\nof the subject was used to help solve the \\nproblems of the group. In most cases, \\nwhen a problem was presented, there were \\nseveral worthy solutions suggested by \\nmembers of the group. It seemed as \\nthough each problem had been encoun- \\ntered by many and solved by at least a few. \\nThe solutions were also written down on \\nthe board opposite the statement of the \\nproblem so that members of the group \\ncould follow developments. Any problems \\nremaining unsolved were turned over to \\na committee from within the group for \\nstudy and possible solution, the findings \\nof this committee to be made known to \\nthe remainder of the group on completion \\nof the study. \\nAmong the problems presented at a \\nGeneral Science Clinic were : \\n1. Insufficient equipment. \\n2. Feasibility of general science and mathe- \\nmatics sharing time. \\n3. What to evaluate and how to do it? \\n4. Use of visual aids. \\n5. Value of field trips. \\n6. Should workbooks be used? \\n7. Can general science be successfully corre- \\nlated with other subjects? \\n8. How can we interest the low ability, slow- \\nreader or under-privileged child in science? \\nTeachers who have participated in these \\nclinics to date acclaim them as the most \\nvaluable and helpful type of conference in \\nwhich they have taken part. \\nPAUL F.

A num- \\nber of these individual reports pertain to \\npromising practices in secondary-school \\nscience. Every science teacher will profit \\nin his philosophy of science teaching by \\nscanning this Bulletin. \\nTHE WORLD AT WORK \\nA series of pamphlets which should \\nprove to be of value to science teachers \\nas well as to teachers of social studies \\nis being prepared by the National Youth \\nAdministration of the Federal Security \\nAgency under the supervision of Charles \\nH. Judd, Educational Consultant, with the \\ncooperation of the General Electric Com- \\npany, the Rural Electrification Administra- \\ntion, and the National Bureau of Stand- \\nards. The purpose of the series “is to \\nsupply information about some of the serv- \\nices which Government renders for the \\npeople of the United States, about the way \\nin which invention has stimulated the de- \\nvelopment of some of the great industries \\nof the country, and about ways in which \\nthe young men and young women of \\nAmerica can participate in productive work \\nthat will be of profit to themselves and to \\nthe Nation.” \\nTo date the following pamphlets, avail- \\nable from the Superintendent of Docu- \\nments, Washington, D. C., at fifteen cents \\neach, have been published : Number Title \\n1 .......... Electricity \\n2 .......... Standards \\n3 .......... Agriculture \\n4 .......... Roads \\n5 .......... Automobiles \\n6 .......... Weather \\nThe booklets are unusually well illus- \\ntrated with large cuts and are printed in \\na format which makes reading easy. It \\nseems evident that a large number of pub- \\nlications in this series should add very \\nworthwhile material for pupils in science \\nclasses at the elementary and secondary \\nschool levels and for adults. It is material \\nof this kind which will aid our pupils and \\ncitizens to recognize more clearly the civic \\nand social significance of science in modern \\nliving. May we express the hope that the \\nseries will be a long one, and that later \\npamphlets will be as valuable as those \\nwhich it has been our pleasure to examine. \\nCONSERVATION UNITS \\nThe Emergency Conservation Commit- \\ntee, of which Mrs. C. N. Edge is chairman, \\nhas published six units dealing with vari- \\nous phases of conservation. The titles of \\nthese units are as follows : (1) “Shortage \\nof Waterfowl”, (2) “Hawks”, (3) “Two \\nEagles of North America”, (4) “Fish- \\nEating Birds”, (5) “Owls”, (6) “Our \\nNation’s Forests.” \\nThese units appear to be of particular \\nvalue for biology teachers, containing spe- \\ncific suggestions for the teacher. They are \\nsold at ten cents a copy. \\nIn addition to these purchasable publi- \\ncations the Committee has issued several \\nfree publications on various phases of con- \\nservation some of which will be usable by \\nteachers of science and also by high-school \\nstudents.

The younger \\nteachers may not remember the separate \\ncourses in botany, zoology and human \\nphysiology, but many active science \\nteachers can remember the years when \\ngeneral science and general biology made \\ngreat progress in winning the support of \\nmany schools and pupils. During the last \\nfew years we have been witnessing the \\ncoming of consumer science, integrated \\nscience, descriptive science, core-curricu- \\nlum science, and similar courses. These \\nherald the coming of several generalized \\ncourses which may, within a decade or two, \\nsettle down to one or more generalized \\ncourses which will be rather widely ac- \\ncepted by schools and pupils. One of these \\nnew generalized courses may be an attempt \\nto integrate the physical sciences much as \\nthe biological sciences are now integrated. \\nAnother may he a core-curriculum study \\nin which the science is integrated with one \\nor more other subjects and all taught by \\nthe one teacher. \\nWhen botany, zoology, human physiol- \\nogy, and physical geography were shrink- \\ning in the face of the growth of general \\nscience and general biology, there were \\nmany and often loud expressions of regret \\nand fear. Many teachers and subject mat- \\nter specialists predicted dire results and \\ncalled on each other to give support to the \\nsubjects through which they had achieved \\ntheir preparation. Now many physics and \\nchemistry teachers are calling on each other \\nfor support because their realm is being \\ninvaded by attempts at fusion. Similarly, \\nscience teachers are now beginning to fear \\nthe results of the core-curriculum type of \\nscience. If we may predict the effect on physics and chemistry from the effects pro- \\nduced by the introduction of biology, then \\nwe may say that these subjects, as now \\norganized, are on the way out. The suc- \\ncess of core-curriculum science would mean \\nthat both biological and physical sciences, \\nas now organized, would be dropped. \\nAlong with these developments toward \\nintegration, it is pertinent to call attention \\nto the organization and growth of associ- \\nations of science teachers affiliated with \\nscience organizations composed of teachers \\nworking largely at college levels. Here we \\nmay mention such groups as the Division \\nof Chemical Education, The American \\nScience Teachers Association, The Ameri- \\ncan Associ9tion of Physics Teachers, The \\nAmerican Association of Biology Teachers. \\nThese groups are, more or less, obviously \\norganized to promote the development of \\nthe sciences and hinder the invasion of their \\nrealm by generalized courses. Many of the \\nmembers of these groups label the general- \\nized courses as “neither integrated Oor \\nscientific.” They often call these attempts, \\n“scrambled science” or “glorified general \\nscience.” \\nHere indeed are trends which are at the \\nstage where we as science teachers may \\ninfluence them. We may encourage the \\nmovement toward generalized physical and \\ncore-curriculum science or we may stand \\nfirm in the defense of the subjects as we \\nknow them. Should we be conservatives or \\nrebels? Should we be neutrals or partici- \\npants ? Should we be isolationists, inter- \\nested observers, or supporters ? What kind \\nof a science program do we want? \\nPersonally, I cannot enlist wholeheart- \\nedly on either the progressive or the con- \\nservative side. I desire to promote gen- \\neralized courses which are integrated and \\nscientific, as well as to promote the intro- \\nduction or re-introduction and growth of \\nthe specialized sciences. This means that \\n285 [ VOL. 24, No. 5 286 SCIENCE EDUCATION \\nfor secondary levels I believe in well- \\nbalanced, integrated, and substantial gen- \\neral science courses, to give the boys and \\ngirls the general understandings, attitudes, \\nand scientific facts which are necessary for \\ninteresting and intelligent living. These \\ngeneral science courses should include the \\nbiological, physical, earth, and astronomical \\nsciences. Following the general science, \\nthere should be semi-specialization and a \\ndeeper penetration into the understandings, \\nattitudes and mastery of facts, in two broad \\nscience areas ; the biological sciences and \\nthe physical sciences. The latter should \\ninclude some earth science and astronomy. \\nFollowing tliese two broad courses there \\nshould be one or more specialized courses. \\nThe offerings at this level would be de- \\ntermined largely by the interests of the \\nstudents, the vocational and recreational \\nopportunities in the community, and the \\ncompetency of the teachers. These courses \\nfor the twelfth year and post graduate \\nlevels may include one or more such \\ncourses as : Floriculture, Gardening, Bot- \\nany, Biology, Bacteriology, Physiology, \\nPhysics, Chemistry, Chemistry for Nurses, \\nElectronics, Geology, Astronomy, Photog- \\nraphy, Aerodynamics, Entomology, and \\nothers. Of course, the physics and chem- \\nistry at this level would be different from \\nthe courses as we know them, because \\nmuch basic physics and chemistry would \\nhave been mastered in the earlier courses. \\nAfter the semi-specialization in biology and \\ngeneral physical science, students may elect \\nfor one or more terms in courses which \\ngive them more thorough preparation in \\none or more circumscribed areas. \\nAccording to this plan, all schools would \\noffer a twelve year science program, com- \\nposed of six years elementary science, \\nthree years general science, one year bio- \\nlogical science, one year general physical \\nscience, and one or more terms of some \\nrather specialized sciences. All along this \\nprogram there should be intelligent coop- \\neration with the teachers of other subjects so that all the offerings of the school may \\nbecome a meaningful whole rather than a \\nnumber of rather isolated parcels. Thus, \\nwhenever a student happened to drop out \\nof school, he would go with a maximum of \\nthat general preparation which would help \\nhim to live understandingly and eagerly in \\na world of science. \\nWhere do you stand in relation to the \\ndevelopments which face us? \\nPIIILIP G.

These are hit two of many \\nreferences to the contributions which func- \\ntional teaching of science may make to \\neconomic well-being. \\nJUNIOR COLLEGES \\nNeed for terminal education in junior \\ncolleges is being discussed this fall in 20 \\nconferences in a nationwide series, under \\nthe sponsorship of the American Xssocia- \\ntion of Junior Colleges. A few quotations \\nfrom a release of the Association will be of \\ninterest to our readers and will suggest to \\nscience teachers certain items to which we \\nniust direct attention in making our science \\ncourses contribute their part in the general \\neducation of youth. \\nAlthough 66 per cent of junior college students \\nprepare to go on into four-year colleges or uni- \\nversities, only 25 per cent actually do go on, says \\nDr. Walter C. Eells of Washington, D. C., direc- \\ntor of the Commission on Junior College Ter- \\nminal Education, in leading the discussions. This \\nsituation, he insists, is untenable, since “students \\nshould not be educated for something they will \\nnot do if they can be better educated for the \\nthings they will do. The things they will do are \\nto scek employment, enter into citizenship and \\nestablish homes.” \\nFigures presented by Dr. Eells show how the \\njunior colleges in the several accrediting areas \\ncompare with the national average in what might \\nbe called the misdirection of student effort. The \\npercentage of junior college students who prepare \\nto go on into senior colleges or universities is \\ncompared with the percentage who actually \\ncontinue : \\nPrepare Continue \\nUnited States ......... 66 25 \\nNew England ......... 35 27 \\nMiddle States ......... 68 32 \\nNorth Central ........ 77 27 \\nSouthern ............. 69 25 \\nNorthwest ............ 78 26 \\n“The time has passed,” says Dr. Eells, “when \\neveryone who goes to college can be educated \\nfor a profession. The professions absorb only \\nsix per cent of the population. Preparation for \\nthese professions is the primary function of the \\nuniversities. But approximately one-half of the \\ngainful workers in the country, proprietors, man- \\nagers, clerical and skilled labor, are in occupa- \\ntions which are distinctly on the semiprofessional “Here is a wide open field for the junior col- \\nleges. More than 300 junior colleges are already \\ngiving semiprofessional and general cducation to \\nabout one-third of their 120,000 students. But \\namong all the 600 junior colleges in the country, \\nwith 200,000 students, the proportion is far \\nlower.” \\nADVENTURES IN BIOLOGY \\nA second edition of Advciitures in Biol- \\nogy (1940), by the New York City Asso- \\nciation of I3iology Teachers, represents a \\nmarked advance over the 1934 edition. The \\ncommittee which prepared tlie new mono- \\ngraph deserves our hearty congratulations \\nfor an outstanding contribution to the \\nteaching of biology. \\nTwo hundred sixty-five projects, with \\ndirections, are classified under eight groups, \\neach group representing a major topic or \\nunit of a course in biology. Four hundred \\nforty-six books and pamphlets are found \\nin the bibliography of publications to which \\nspecific references are made in the direc- \\ntions for the projects. \\nWhile it is true that many of the projects \\nare concerned with the plant and environ- \\nment of New York City, the monograph \\nwill enrich any course in biology. Sug- \\ngestions for the use of tlie projects are \\ncontained in an excellently-written intro- \\nduction. At the end of the monograph is \\na particularly helpful index to the projects. \\nThis index is in three sections (1 ) projects \\ninvolving various types of activities, such \\nas growing plants, making apparatus, and \\nusing a camera, (2) projects involving \\nbiological ideas, such as absorption, germi- \\nnation and hormone action, and (3) proj- \\nects involving different kinds of organisms, \\nsuch as protozoa, insects, and trees. \\nInformation concerning the monograph \\nis obtainable from Mrs. Estella R.

The following list \\nof questions is arranged in the order of \\ntheir importance to the one hundred \\nteachers present at that meeting : \\nWhat materials are available for the teach- \\ning science? \\nHow does one determine what materials to \\ngive children on their age level? \\nHow can we evaluate the outcomes of \\nscience teaching? \\nHow can science enrich the elementary \\nschool program? \\nHow can one get content for the teaching \\nof elementary science? \\nHow would you get elementary science \\nstarted in the classroom? \\naddition, at the first meeting, mem- \\nbers of the Executive Committee discussed \\n(1) the status of science teaching in the \\nelementary school, (2) science as related \\nto contemporary life and to the school pro- \\ngram, and (3) why teach science in the \\nelementary school. \\nSuccessive meetings have attempted to \\nanswer the problems and questions of \\nteachers as determined by the question- \\nnaire. Mr. W. W. McSpadden presented \\nmaterials used and results of work done by \\nsixth-grade children in the field of elec- \\ntricity. This meeting ended the work of \\nthe Council for the school year of 1939. \\nThe school year 1939-1940 opened with \\nthe Council presenting on October 6, 1939, \\na panel consisting of both elementary and \\nsecondary school people. This panel con- \\nsidered the value of teaching science in the \\nelementary school before tlie science section \\nof the Long Island Zone meeting of the \\nNew York State Teachers Association in \\nHempstead. \\nThe Council presented at their next \\nmeeting experiments using inexpensive ma- terial that could be used in the field of air \\npressure from the primary level to the \\nupper intermediate, The experiments were \\npresented by Mr. Ernest Owen, consultant, \\nMr. Robert Wilson, science teacher, and \\nMrs. Scott, classroom teacher. \\nTwo groups of children from tlie Man- \\nhasset and Garden City Schools demon- \\nstrated science learnings for the Council’s \\nthird meeting. \\nOn May 9, 1940, at the East Street \\nSchool in IIicksville, the Council turned its \\nattention to science books and a suggested \\noutfit of science equipment. This termi- \\nnated the year’s program of tlie Long \\nIsland Science Council attended by enthusi- \\nastic classroom teachers throughout the \\nyear. \\nThe business of the organization is con- \\nducted by the Executive Committee, Occa- \\nsional guests are invited to these Executive \\nmeetings to give their aid and suggestions \\nin planning the future meetings and policies \\nof the Council. The Executive Committee \\noriginally consisted of four people and has \\nincreased to seven. The members at \\npresent are : hiliss Helene Nichols, Science \\nConsultant, Manhasset ; Mr. 0. J.

Science teachers and supervisors \\nwill participate in the problem in a truly \\nscientific attitude, we trust. \\nAn attempt at the study of one aspect \\nof the general problem is described in the \\nfollowing statement by Earl C. Wolfe, \\nhead of the Science department, sent us \\nby Principal Clarence W. Johnson, of the \\nDowners Grove Community High School, \\nDowners Grove, Illinois. \\nScience is an important part of most human \\nproblems. In the study of human problems, social \\nscience courses usually omit the science phases. \\nOn the other hand, the science courses often do \\nnot relate their findings to the large social \\nproblems. \\nTo offset this partition in subject matter, a \\nfreshman class in Downers Grove High School \\nworks together for three hours per day on prob- \\nlems which are not separated into subject matter \\ndivisions. Three teachers with training in differ- \\nent fields cooperate in directing the work. In \\nareas including problems of school, community, \\nhome, and self exploration, the students and \\nteachers together collect, organize, and then sub- \\ndivide units of work until each student is develop- \\ning a personally interesting aspect of a major \\nproblem for which he is responsible to the rest \\nof the class. \\nThe student may solve his part of the problem \\nby reading, interviewing, visiting industry, or \\nexperimenting in the laboratory. In his labora- \\ntory hour no attempt is made to exclude social \\naspects of his study, and in the social science \\nlibrary, science material and scientific procedure \\nare encouraged. In pact, at no time is there a \\nsegregation of the science, English, or social \\nphases of the problem. \\nWhen the solution of a problem includes an \\nexperiment, the student and the teacher plan \\ntogether the method of procedure. The student \\nmay experiment for his own information, he may \\ndemonstrate as part of his report, or he may \\ndirect the class to experiment individually. For \\nexample, in a study of natural resources, one \\nstudent read extensively on oil refinement. With \\nthe help of a senior science student he set up a \\nfractional distillatinil of crcide oil. Continuous \\noperation of this “plant” fir several days pre- \\nsented this process more clearly than words or \\npictures. Anuther boy studying ceramics found \\nthat several kinds of clay are used. He learned \\nsimple nicthods of testing these clays, and then \\nhad each student in class conduct these tests. \\nScores of such experiments are performed without \\nrepetition. These experiments are not previously \\norganized or standardized, but are developed to \\naid the student in understanding and solving his particular problem. Only the nature of his prob- \\nlem determines what experiments he performs. \\nComparison of students of this class with those \\nof traditional general science classes as revealed \\nby the standardized testing program shows thein \\nto be about equal in factual informa.tion gained. \\nThese students contact a wider variety of science \\nproblems than usual. The advantages of their \\nexperiences in planning and organizing are evident \\nin later class work. These students learn \\nthe practical use of the scientific method in \\nspite of inadequate data. In finding their prob- \\nlems, these students sense the application of \\nscience in broad social problems. \\nApiother tyl/e of iiitegratioiz of scievzce. \\nMajor problems of living, or life activities, \\nare often large in scope calling for refer- \\nence to different areas of Iiuman endeavor, \\nor subject fields. Such problems or activ- \\nities are coninion in the elementary school \\ncurriculum. In recent years, there has \\nbeen an increasing number of attempts to \\nemploy similar plans of organization in \\njunior and senior high schools. \\nAn interesting variety of this kind of \\nexperience with the curriculum is illus- \\ntrated in the Deinonstration High School, \\nWest Virginia University. The statement \\nconcerning tlie practice tliere employed on \\nan experimental basis is furnished by \\nGeorge A. Federer, Jr., Coordinating \\nTeacher, Science Department. \\nFor a number of years an experimental group \\n01 ninth-grade pupils have been starting the first \\nyear in high school by working for two hours \\nduring the day with one teacher.* During this \\ntwo-hour period, tlie teacher, with the group, \\nagreed upon a central topic or theme for study. \\nFollowing the selection of the topic the pupils \\nwere given the opportunity of spending an hour \\nevery other day with the science teacher. One \\ntheme selected under this particular plan was \\nentitled, “Know Your School.” \\nThe general science class approached this topic \\nin a direct manner by giving consideration to the \\nscientific problems about the school building and \\nthe canipus. The materials used in the construc- \\ntion of the school building such as the flooring, \\nthe dccorative marble, brick, spouting and insulat- \\ning materials were studied. In many cases \\nsainples of these materials were obtained from the \\nmanufacturing companies with literature explain- \\ning their properties. Visual aids were used \\nwhere possible so as to give the pupil the com- \\n* (See previous account of this procedure by \\nGeorge H. Colebank.

An estimate of the cost of fuel \\nfor the building was made with consideration of \\nthe by-products that are lost from the furnace. \\nA rather complete investigation of the heating \\nand ventilating system was carried out. Frequent \\nfield trips were made about the extensive campus \\nin which the class studied the trees, plants, seed- \\ning the lawn, flowers, strata of rock and soil \\nerosion. In considering the beautification of the \\nlawn one pupil suggested the construction of a \\nsundial similar to the one which she had observed \\npictured in a book. This bit of construction was \\na wonderful learning situation within itself. \\nBooks were not used in formulating these exer- \\ncises, but instead, they were used as aids in solv- \\ning the problems. Constant alertness on the part \\nof the pupil towards the explanation of the science \\ninvolved in his environment is very commendable \\nwith this type of curriculum. \\nLearning and serzing by doing in science. \\nIt has required a long time for too many \\nteachers of science to relate functionally \\ntheir subject content with real, personal \\nand social living. ’The curves of percen- \\ntage of enrollment of secondary-school \\npupils in the oldline sciences speak forcibly \\nthe results of academic-minded teachers. \\nThe awakening-shall we say, resurrection \\n-may be coming. More and more we \\nhear of evidence of its approach, even \\nthough visitation of high-school science \\nclasses fails, at times, to provide highly \\neiicouraging hope. \\n“Thinking inheres in action” is a guid- \\ning principle that progressive teachers have \\nheard and practiced. We have far to ad- \\nvance in dynamically accepting the motto \\nin our science teaching. A brief statement, \\nprepared by James M. Martin, head of the \\nscience department of Ellerbe High School, \\nEllerbe, North Carolina, and sent us by \\nPrincipal Richard F. Little of that school, \\nshows how one group of students is guided \\nin functional learning. \\nEvery effort is being made at Ellerbe to make \\nhigh school science courses of a practical nature, \\nin the belief that “Ellerbe students learn by \\ndoing.” Thus students of a general science class, \\nwhile studying a unit on light and home illumina- \\ntion, drew plans for the arrangement of the new \\nscience laboratories in order to insure obtaining \\nthe maximum amount of natural illumination as \\nwell as artificial light from the already existing \\nfixtures. The value received from this project has not limited itself simply to subject matter but \\nhas revealed itself in the pride and joy which \\nthese students manifest in having had a part in \\nthe planning of their new science rooms as shown \\nby their care of them. \\nWhile studying the skeletal system, the biology \\nclasses felt the need for some sort of animal \\nskeleton to use in their class work. As this type \\nof material is expensive, and the school funds at \\nEllerbe are very limited, no solution seemed \\npossible. Then a student spoke of having seen \\na large dog skeleton in a wood while out hunting. \\nA field trip was taken to this wood and the bones \\ncollected. Back in the laboratory these bones \\nwere carefully cleaned, bleached, and mounted. \\nThe finished product was a skeleton that would \\nserve the use of any high school as well as the \\nmost expensive commercial skeleton obtainable. \\nWhen the project was completed, the students \\nwere surprised to find that they not onIy knew \\nthe names of more bones than their text sug- \\ngested they learn, but also had obtained an \\nimpression of the relationship of the skeleton to \\nthe internal organs and the muscles of the body \\nthat they would never have received from study- \\ning the bones of a skeleton already assembled. \\nThe science department was desirous of a radio. \\nAgain the problem of money had to be confronted. \\nA physics class decided that, while studying their \\nunit on radio, they would attempt to build a \\nreceiving set. Several discarded radio sets were \\ncontributed by interested people in the community. \\nWith the parts obtained from these a small serv- \\niceable radio was built for the department. So \\ngreat was the carry-over of this unit that several \\nstudents who did not have radios at home decided \\nto build sets for their families. With the coopera- \\ntion of the local radio dealer, who was only too \\nglad to get rid of some of the old worn-out radios \\nin his warehouse, two boys, without any super- \\nvision, built larger sets of which they justly had \\na right to be proud. \\nIt is the aim of the science department to cor- \\nrelate its work with that of other departments in \\nthe school. While one English class was studying \\na unit on the telephone, the physics class likewise \\nbegan a study of this instrument. Ellerbe’s stu- \\ndents, being from a rural community, have little \\nopportunity to use or understand a telephone. \\nWith this fact in mind the physics class visited \\nthe local telephone office and later was given \\nseveral discarded telephone units. By salvaging \\nall usable parts, two working telephones were \\ninstalled in English classrooms, forming an in- \\ntercommunication system for the use of that \\ndepartment in its telephone units. Thus it is \\nthat Ellerbe science students not only learn but \\nalso serve by doing. \\nIt has often \\nbeen said that the best measure of success \\nof a course is the voluntary activity per- \\nformed by the student after the course ‘‘is Filling the vacation gap. \\n 1098237x, 1941, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730250411 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Leroy Thompson, Superin- \\ntendent, Washington Irving Schools, \\nTarrytown, New York, suggests a kind of \\nvacation activity in science which has un- \\ndoubted merit and which might prompt \\nother teachers of science to carry on. \\nDuring July pupils of the Washington Irving \\nSchools in Tarrytown, New York, enjoy the \\nprivilege of learning more about the branch of \\nScience in which they are interested. Classes \\nunder regular instructions from 9-12 o’clock in \\nthe morning five days a week with one or two \\nafternoon field trips every week, round out a \\nmonth of, shall we say, “intellectual enjoyment” \\nfor all concerned. With no assignments, no \\nattendance records and no examinations many \\nhave inquired as to just what is done. \\nOn the first day the pupils are asked to crystal- \\nlize their scientific interests in one definite area. \\nIt is here that careful thought on the part of the \\ninstructor determines the success or failure for \\nthe session. With children from fourth grade \\nthrough the post graduate level in one group the \\nproblem at first seems impossible. But one or \\ntwo examples will show that this wide age range \\nis really an asset. \\nLast summer a High School Senior, a fourth- \\ngrade girl and a sixth-grade boy wanted to learn \\nmore about Hydroponics, or the soilless growth \\nof plants. The three people co-operated very \\nnicely, the Senior learning by teaching the \\nyounger people who mastered the technique of \\nthe process with apparently little effort. The \\nSenior enjoyed himself trying out new formulas, \\nvarious methods of aeration, etc. Field trips \\nthrough the Boyce-Thompson Institute at Yonk- \\ners, N. Y., and a commercial water-culture “farm” \\nin a nearby village were revealing as to the \\namount of information the pupils had gathered \\nand applied. Their questions evidenced a wide \\nand definite knowledge of the subject. \\nAnother example was the Photography group, \\nwhich numbered twelve pupils at different age and \\ninformational levels. Their daily round table \\ndiscussions on the result of the previous day’s \\nwork brought about a mastery of the simplest \\nelements involved for even the youngest, whereas \\nthe older people were stimulated by having to \\ndiagnose and prove to the younger people where \\nthe trouble originated. Their work in reducing \\nand intensifying negatives ; their enlarging, dodg- ing and cropping on different grades and quality \\npapers, with different exposure and developing \\ntimes, instilled deeply lessons which will not soon \\nbe forgotten. \\nCase after case could be cited in radio, micro- \\nscopic work, mineralogy, etcetera, to show the \\npractical value of this type of schooling. There \\nseems to be some indication that the grouping of \\ndifferent age and informational levels together are \\nof distinct value. The older people are inspired \\nto further learning by the many questions of the \\nyounger group whereas the younger groups are \\nmore free and open with their questions to high \\nschool people than they would normally be to \\nadult teachers. \\nIt is only natural for pupils to work hardest at \\nthe thing they find most interesting. Is it not \\ntherefore the responsibility of our educational \\nsystems to guide these children in their chosen \\ninterests without the more or less formal disci- \\nplinary routine of the regular school year? This \\ntype of summer school seems to fill that gap. \\nBy inference and example one can readily see \\nthat the plan is wholly individual instruction, the \\nstudents gaining in terms of their interest and \\nability. \\nSUMMER CONFERENCE OF THE NEW \\nENGLAND ASSOCIATION OF \\nCHEMISTRY TEACHERS \\nFollowing two very successful Summer \\nConferences, the New England Association \\nof Chemistry Teachers is making plans for \\nthe Third Annual Conference to be held \\nthis summer on the campus of the Univer- \\nsity of Connecticut, Stoors, Connecticut, on \\nAugust 12, 13, 14, and 15, 1941.

A \\nset comprises a series of geometrical figures \\nsuch as circles, squares, rectangles, tri- \\nangles, and ovals of different sizes with a \\nvarying number of arms representing the \\npositive and negative valence of elements \\nor radicals. The figures fit naturally to- \\ngether with arrows and slots, and by read- \\ning off the labelled atomic numbers and \\nchemical symbols, such difficult concepts in \\ngeneral inorganic chemistry as ionization, \\nvalence, chemical equations and formulae, \\nchemical activity, and the periodic arrange- \\nment of elements, etc., are clearly visual- \\nized. \\nBright chemistry students may find \\nthese blocks an economy in learning, while \\naverage students may utilize them as the \\nvisual means of grasping the difficult fun- \\ndamental concepts of chemistry. The \\nblocks may be used to play an educational \\nand interesting game similar to dominoes \\nwith any number of students or players \\nparticipating. The complexity of the game \\nwill vary with the players’ mastery of the \\nscience. \\nLiterally thousands of formulas and \\nequations are possible by fitting different \\nblocks together and reading off the results \\nso obtained. \\nLarge sets might be built for blackboard \\ndemonstration by teachers, and braille \\nlabeled blocks have been used by blind \\nstudents. \\nARTHUR H.

Those whose naines \\nand pictures have been included in text- \\nbooks in the past are worthy of honor and \\nhave inspired pupils. It is a good idea \\nto show honor to great scientists in our \\ntextbooks and we would eliminate some \\nof them only to enlarge the idea and make \\nroom for even greater men. \\nWe rate scientists in greatness on the \\nimportance of their contributions, of \\ncourse. If we say that one inan is a \\ngreater scientist than another, we refer \\nnot to his genius or lack of it, nor to the \\nhumbleness of his origin, nor to the ob- \\nstacles he had to surmount, but only to \\nthe value of his discoveries. A stricken \\ninan who overcomes seemingly insuperable \\nhandicaps to make a minor contribution to \\nscience is a great character but not a great \\nscientist. A slight acquaintance with the \\nhistory of science confirms the point. Use- \\nfulness is, in fact, the world’s criterion of \\nscientific greatness. \\nIf that much be granted, the rest fol- \\nlows very simply. For example, if Koch \\nbe great because he discovered the germs \\nof tuberculosis, anthrax, et cefern (very \\nuseful knowledge), with his microscope, \\nhow much greater is the man who origi- \\nnated the microscope and thus made pos- \\nsible the great usefulness of not only Koch \\nbut also Sch~vann, Schleiden, Pasteur, \\nBrown. and innunierable others ! Again, \\nif other scientists are great (and who can \\ndoubt it ?) because of the discoveries they \\nmade using solid culture media, how very \\ngreat is Koch because he first learned to \\nraise microorganisms on the solid culture \\nmedia of boiled potatoes! The more \\nft,ndamental techniques and inventions open new worlds of discovery to the \\nhuman race. \\nBut let us not stop here; let us go back \\nto a class of men whose work was even \\nmore fundamental, whose work was basic \\nto the usefulness of even a Koch or a \\nVon Leewenhocli. This is a class of men \\nso useful that we may well call them super- \\nscientists, or super-heroes, or the greater \\nGods of Science. The greatest of the \\ngreat are those who develop the scientific \\nmethod itself from which flow all tech- \\nniques and inventions of research, and in \\nturn, the already immense body of useful \\ninformation of a more direct application in \\ndaily life. \\nIn this list of the super-great I would \\ninclude Socrates, the great skeptic. He \\nquestioned everything and induced clearer \\nthinking. He is first both historically \\nand logically-doubt is the beginning of \\nwisdom. Also, Plato, the great logician. \\nHe developed constructive and systematic \\nthinking which is essential for truth-find- \\ning. And then in Aristotle, the third of \\nthose I would like to honor as stars of the \\nfirst magnitude, the human race began to \\ncollect specimens and facts, and learn that \\ndoubt and clear thinking alone are insuffi- \\ncient, that we must find out about things \\nfrom the things themselves. \\nBut by 1564 A.D. all but about one per \\ncent of the writings of the ancients had \\nbeen lost and most of the one per cent \\nthat remained had been perverted. There \\nhad been a thousand years 01 regression \\nin scientific progress-the Dark Ages. \\nAristotle, wlio had shown that there are \\nno atithorities except the facts of nature \\nthemselves, had been set up as fhe author- \\nity on all things mundane. Honest doubt \\nhad again to rear its challenging head. \\nInductive thinking had never been worked \\nout and had to be created. The facts of \\nnature had again to be installed as the 50 SCIENCE EDUCATION [VOL. 25, Kn. 1 \\nauthority on all things inundane. The con- \\ntrolled experiment, which was the next \\nnecessary step in scientific progress, had \\nto be invented. Because one man was \\nlargely responsible for accomplishing all \\nthese thiiigs, I regard him, Galileo, as the \\ngreatest of the great Gods of Science. \\nA culture can be judged by its Gods and \\nHeroes and ours is called a scientific age. \\nBut not only do we honor mostly the lesser \\nGods of Science, but we honor the greater \\nGods of Science for their lesser contribu- \\ntions. Galileo, the unsurpassed Galileo, is \\nhonored for such comparative trivialities \\nas inventing the telescope and seeing spots \\non the sun! It is as though we were to \\nhonor Einstein in our textbooks with a \\nphotograph and the legend, “Einstien, \\nAlbert, American ; Invented the Einstien \\nSafety Brake for Baby Carriages !” \\nWith these four I would place also: \\nNewton, who taught us how to use the \\nscientific hypothesis ; Agassiz, who taught \\nus how to train scientists by the hundreds ; \\nand Thurstone, who is now busy replac- \\ning factor-analysis-by-guesswork with fac- \\ntor-analysis-by-statistical-treatment. \\nThese are surely some of the greater \\nGods of Science. Theirs are not petty dis- \\ncoveries and inventions ; they give the \\ninvaluable SCIENTIFIC METHOD to \\nman’s groping and muddy mind. Super- \\nScientists, they teach and inspire disciples \\nwithout number and thus multiply the use- \\nfulness of millions of lesser men. While \\nthe lesser Gods might be considered good \\nenough for our lesser science courses \\nwhere “useful information” is regarded as \\nthe only gift worth taking, in functional \\nscience courses we appreciate the greatest \\ngifts of science to man: scientific method, \\nattitude, and skill. It is seemly that we \\nshould most honor those who gave the \\ngreatest gifts: ours should be the greater \\nGods of Science! \\nPHILIP B. SHARPE, \\nGyeenzen’ch High School, \\nGrecnzaicli, New York NEW AND PROMISING PRACTICES \\nOn every hand one hears of challenging \\nchanges in organization, instruction, and \\nevaluation in science teaching. It is our \\ndesire to bring to the attention of our \\nreaders descriptions of worthy innovations. \\nOur readers are invited to send us for \\npublication and editorial comment brief \\nstatements of their activities directed to- \\nward the improvement of the function \\nand practice of science instruction. State- \\nments should be limited to 100-500 words. \\nLonger descriptions will be excerpted in \\nthis section of the Journal or will be con- \\nsidered as articles. Let us hear what you \\nare doing. \\nAn experience curriculum. The emerg- \\ning curriculum has been through several \\nstages. One thinks of the subject matter \\ncurriculum, the project curriculum, the \\nproblem curriculum, the activity curricu- \\nlum, the experience curriculum, and so on. \\nProbably a good “curriculum” in science \\nincludes elements and values from each \\nof the various approaches and organiza- \\ntions. Certainly the spirit of the plan and \\nthe artistry of the teacher will make or \\nbreak the educational potentialities of any \\n“curriculum in science.” A description \\nof “an experience curriculum” received \\nfrom George R. Biecher, Teacher of Bi- \\nology, Chambersburg (Pennsylvania) High \\nSchool, is so challenging that we quote his \\nstatement : \\nLet us pause for a brief reflection in our sci- \\nence teaching to ask: If I were employed to \\nwatch a btock of machines turning out a stand- \\nard machine part, or knitting hose, or if perhaps \\nto act as a nursemaid to an automatic machine \\nlathe; would it really matter if there is a pair \\nof nephric tubules in each segment of the earth- \\nworm? Would I be concerned about a molar \\nsolution of cupric chloride, or the conjugate foci \\nof curved mirrors? Is it not true that our high \\nschool graduates will operate these automatic \\nmachines with little regard for the technical \\ndifficulties of the science laboratory? \\nWith this situation as a definite problem, the \\nfaculty of Chambersburg High School has been \\nrevising its curriculum. This does not mean \\nthat we have discontinued the training of college \\npreparatory students. But it does mean that \\nminimum requirements of the whole curriculum \\n 1098237x, 1941, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730250112 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Then again we meet a chal- \\nlenge. We can not teach English, and leave \\nchemistry, physics, or biology to the science de- \\npartment, 01’ vice versa. A brief survey of the \\ncourse in biology will serve to illustrate. Let \\nus follow the correlation applicable to the prob- \\nlem of sex education in the course. \\nThe Chambersburg biology student orients him- \\nself as a living animal by an imaginary world \\ncruise. As to sex education, he has learned \\nthat he is an animal. If he is one of the less \\ncapable “non-academic” pupils, that is perhaps \\nall that he will appreciate; so limited an appre- \\nciation being indictive of very few high school \\npupils. Furthermore, he will have completed \\nthe minimum requirements, designated as “x” \\nactivities, in “A Searching Party,” the first unit \\nin his course. It is also the first unit, in the \\nfirst of seven “Experience Groups,” bearing the \\ngroup title “The Distribution of Life on the \\nEarth.” An academic or more capable non- \\nacademic pupil has taken “Extra Expense \\nTours,” by the expenditure of greater effort in \\nthe same allotted time. Such a tour has involved \\nmore detailed ecological studies, designated as \\n“y” or “z” activities. His ability has been chal- \\nlenged to capacity, but he has made the choice \\nof his extra work. At the same time he may \\nhave become interested in ecology, geography, \\nnature study, exploration, or a host of other \\navocational interests. He may have developed \\nhobbies that broaden his sphere of life. Will \\nsex consciousness disturb his anticipation for \\nthat avocational interest, when he leaves the \\nautomatic machine for the day? The average \\ngraduate will also enjoy his evening newspaper \\nor magazine the more, because he has prepared \\na biological scrapbook of clippings, pictures, quo- \\ntations, and poetry from these sources; also be- \\ncause he has used the vocabulary list accompany- \\ning the unit, in good English narration; or by \\nhis oial reports made from searching a compre- \\nhensive though not exhaustive bibliography of \\ngood popular periodical literature. Oral reports \\nwill have been experiences in self confidence \\nand self respect, definite enemies of debased at- \\ntitudes. If the English department cooperates \\nin these reports, the individual will be a delight- \\nfully painless addition to social or conversational \\ngroups. Will you not agree also that such col- \\nlege students will have attitudes upon which to \\nbuild the technical information of the laboratory? \\nTo continue with the major divisions of the \\ncourse, let us consider the remaining pupil ex- \\nperiences in sex education. The second “Expe- \\nrience Group” contains eight units under the \\ntitle “Building a Museum.” Here the first unit \\norganizes a scrapbook into phylogenetic sections \\nof clippings, pressed specimens, and pictures ; \\nwith minimum appreciation of man’s place in \\nrelation to other living forms. Succeeding units \\nof the group include : Microscopic conceptions \\nof structure, microbes as related to disease (in- cluding venereal diseases), insects, fish, amphi- \\nbians and reptiles, birds, and mammals. The \\nmammal unit entitled, “The Hall of Clever Furry \\nCreatures,” encourages an appreciation for vi- \\nviparous pregnancy. \\nThe third “Experience Group” organizes five \\nunits into a comparison of the human body with \\nthe organization of a democratic political state. \\nIn this group the unit on circulation entitled, \\n“The Postal System,” considers the endocrine \\nglands (including the sex glands), as a special \\ndelivery system. The nervous system or final \\nunit of this group is entitled “The State Gov- \\nernment.” In this unit there is ample oppor- \\ntunity for guidance when we have an activity \\ncalled “The State Supreme Court,” correspond- \\ning to the power of thinking and judgment to. \\ndeclare habits good or bad. Cooperation with \\nthe social science department will help to develop \\ncitizenship and practical appreciations during \\ncontemporary political upheaval, as well as the \\nchallenge to control personal choices. \\nIn the seventh and final “Experience Group,” \\nthe pupil experiences the development of sex \\nunder the title, “Passing Life Along.” Unit I, \\n“The Prelude to Life” is a progression from \\nsimple fission or cell division to viviparous sexual \\nreproduction. In this unit the minimum appre- \\nciation illustrates that. sex is nothing more than \\ntwo cells called the egg and the sperm. The \\nsucceeding two units are an appreciation of the \\ntitles “The Future Generations” and “Circum- \\nstantial Evidence.” These units represent guid- \\nance in the marital relation as heredity and \\nevolution. \\nHas Chambersburg High discovered Utopia? \\nCertainly not! The parable of the sower is as \\napplicable today as it was two thousand years \\nago. But, it is the belief of the author that a \\nhigh school faculty thus minded will definitely \\nskew to the right the curve of Mendel’s Law. \\nThe community as a science laboratory. \\nThe effectiveness of instruction in science \\nis in part dependent upon the degree to \\nwhich the work of the classroom reaches \\noutside into the community life and upon \\nthe degree to which the problems and work \\nof the world are brought into the class- \\nroom. The study of science is a social \\nundertaking. How one phase of this co- \\noperation is brought about is reported by \\nPrincipal C. C. Tuck, West Technical \\nHigh School, Cleveland, Ohio, who says \\nconcerning the work in his school, de- \\nscribed briefly in the following quotation, \\n“These activities make for a science pro- \\ngram that functions in the lives of high \\nschool boys and girls. The community not \\n 1098237x, 1941, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730250112 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Unfortunately for \\nthe child the science teacher far too often tries \\nto answer the first question as being the impor- \\ntant issue which indicates a lack of true educa- \\ntional perspective. Of what value can science \\nbe if the child fails in life because of incompe- \\ntence in science-and this does not refer to the \\nfew who fail the course-but to the large number \\nwlio can give lip service and perhaps pass a \\nmemory test. \\nBuilding Michael Faraday’s “Catpower” elec- \\ntric motor, visiting and working with the United \\nStates Weather Bureau, seeing and hearing about \\nthe skies first hand in the Case School Observa- \\ntory on visiting nights, and working with local \\n“Planning Authorities” on a survey of the com- \\nmunity are a few of the activities that help \\nmake the community a part of the pupil. The \\nCleveland Academy of Medicine gladly coop- \\nerates with Cleveland Schools in booking health \\nexperts for talks and discussions with large \\ngroups of pupils on such topics as self-medica- \\ntion, proper use and treatment of eyes, ears, nose \\nand mental hygiene. West Technical High \\nSchool pupils subscribe to this feature with real \\nenthuiasm, recognizing that these are real values \\nas safeguards to insure good health. \\nThe science laboratory therefore becomes a \\ncommunity laboratory and goes beyond the small \\nroom in the science compartment. Soil and \\nchemical gardening, photography and other ac- \\ntivities can be carried on both at home and in \\nschool. Science instruction centered on labora- \\ntory projects or science in which community and \\nschool laboratory projects forms the backbone, \\ninstead of an abstract outline from some book, \\ntend to start the pupils on a science excursion \\nthat is not likely to end when the school subject \\nis completed. \\nPERSONAL AND SOCIAL \\nPROBLEMS OF YOUTH \\nAttention is being directed increasingly \\nto the determination of the real problems \\nand issues of boys and girls of high-school \\nage. A recent investigation, entitled Aiz \\nIiaverito7-y Study of the Persoiial mid Geii- \\nera1 Social Probleiiis of 256 Stiideiats in \\nGmcles Scaeii fo Twelve, Ivcllc rive, has \\nbeen completed by a committee of tlie staff \\nof the Ohio State University School. \\nA check list of 392 problems, gathered by preliminary studies, was subiiiitted to \\na total of 256 pupils, ranging in number \\nfrom 36 to 61 in grades seven to twelve. \\nThe list was divided into two major sec- \\ntions : “Personal Problems” and “General \\nProblems.” Each of the two sections was \\ndivided further into categories. Some of \\nthe categories were : “Family,” ‘‘Voca- \\ntion,” “Pupil-Teacher Relations,” “Our \\nSchool,” “Self-Discipline, Mental Hygiene \\nand Health,” “Planning Work,” “Reli- \\ngion,” “Sex,” “College,” and “Social, \\nEconomic, and Political Organization.” \\nThe pupils’ checks of problems in the \\nlist which seemed important to them pro- \\nvided the data which is summarized in the \\nreport. Comparisons of interest in the \\nproblems are made for grades, sex, and \\ncategories. The results are most revealing. \\nSex differences are slight. Personal prob- \\nlems of youth cover a very wide range \\nsuggesting great variations in courses based \\nupon pupils’ needs. The upper grades show \\na marked increase in interest in world \\naffairs. Pupils in grades seven to ten \\nindicate greater interest in personal or im- \\nmediate needs. The results are in part a \\nreflection of the educational philosophy of \\nthe particular school. \\nScience teachers will peruse with interest \\nthe votes of the pupils 011 those problems \\nwhich may be considered as a part of, or \\nclosely related to, science education. They \\nxdi also find in the report a teciinique \\nwhich may be used to determine pupils’ \\ni:ceds in the field of science. \\nYOUTH AND EDUCATIOS \\nMuch is being written these days about \\nAmerican Youth and their education. \\nTheoretical, philosophical, and practical \\nwords collie from various directions, and \\nniany individuals and coinniittees offer \\ntheir best ideas on one of the greatest \\nproblems confronting the profession today. \\nh check list of 14 publications and 10 \\nforthcoming publications by the Ainericau \\n 1098237x, 1941, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730250112 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

During that time it has consistently \\ngrown in teacher and pupil acceptance. At the \\nstart, in 1932, about 5,000 pupils enrolled for \\nschool and honie gardening projects in some 55 \\nschools; in 1940 there were over 15.400 enrolled \\nin 132 schools-all the elementary and all but two \\nof the junior high schools in the system. \\nActual gardening projects for pupils to carry \\non at home or in a school garden tract, are logical \\nand psychological outgrowths of the elementary \\nscience instruction. If the latter is truly effective \\nit must instill in the pupils the desire to try out \\nand discover for themselves. While many fields \\nof mechanical science are not suited to child \\nparticipation on anything like a scale of full \\nresponsibility, gardening is ideally adapted to a \\ntruly scientific approach by the youngsters who \\nwish to try out for themselves some of the prin- \\nciples of biological science discussed in class. \\nProjects planned from a practical as well as edu- \\ncational standpoint provide for exploring, dis- \\ncovering, creating-expcrience that enriches char- \\nacter and intellect alike. Full responsibility for \\ntrue-life situations in plant growing brings the child into contact with reality, on a scale within \\nhis physical and mental powers. \\nThe Cleveland elementary gardening projects \\nare all voluntary, but specific. For school tract \\ngardens they are combination vegetable and flower \\ngardens ranging in size from 200 to 300 square \\nfeet. On these gardens all work is done under \\nteacher supervision and in regular class groups \\nwhich continue to meet on a regular schedule all \\nthrough the vacation period. A small enrollment \\nfee is paid by each child who signs up for a \\ngarden; all supplies are furnished and all produce \\nbelongs to the children. About 1,100 youngsters \\nparticipate on three garden tracts aggregating \\nnearly 11 acres. \\nHome projects include definitely planned garden \\nplots, box gardens, and house plant growing \\nenterprises, for each of which a small enrollment \\nfee is required (usually 5 cents) and used to pro- \\nvide the necessary seeds and plants. The former \\nare put up in special packets for the gardens \\nas planned, by the Templin Bradley Seed Com- \\npany. Seed collections are assembled, most of \\nthe plants grown, and all of the children’s sup- \\nplies prepared for distribution to the schools at \\nWest Technical High School greenhouse, the \\nsupply center for the Garden Department. Some \\n75,000 packets of seed, 52,000 garden plants, and \\n9,000 house plants were distributed for the home \\nprojects alone in the spring of 1940. \\nThe regular science teachers in the various \\nschools do the work which makes this whole \\nhome project program possible. They distribute \\nthe announcement circulars, take the enrollments \\nand fees, give out the supplies delivered to their \\nbuildings for those enrolled, visit the garden \\nproject children at their homes twice during the \\nsummer (for a small extra con~pensation), con- \\nduct a concluding exhibit after school opens in \\nthe fall, and give out the certificates and awards. \\nThe fact that all this work is voluntary and yet \\ndone Bith positive interest and pleasure in a great \\nmajority of the schools, is tangible evidence that \\nthe school staffs thorouglily believe in the value \\nof the gardening work for their pupils. \\nUnderlying these voluntary home and school \\ngardening projects are the science units of study \\nwhich deal with the plant phases of the subject. \\nTwo specific units on garden planting and garden \\ncare, in fifth and sixth giades respectively, are \\nof definite value to the successful conduct of the \\ngarden projects by those who undertake them. \\nConversely, the gardening is an application and \\ndemonstration of many of the fundamentals taught \\nas science rather than gardening. bringing them \\nto life in practical situations within the compre- \\nhension of the pupils. \\nThe inclusion of gardening instruction as a \\npart of elementary science seems to be both \\nlogical and practical. The training of science \\nteachers is such that only a reasonable amount \\nof specific help is necessary to enable them to do \\na satisfactory job of instruction in gardening. \\nMost science teachers by inclination are garden- \\n 1098237x, 1941, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730250313 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

All sorts of illustrative and deinon- \\nstration material of great value to the science \\nteacher can be supplied from the garden and \\ngreenhouse. In Cleveland this has been developed \\nnotably, insofar as funds and facilities have been \\navailable for organizing and distributing materials. \\nBy proper integration, as the Cleveland organi- \\nzation shows, it is possible for school gardening \\nand science to mutually benefit each other, to the \\nadvantage of both pupils and teachers.

There is thus made available for \\nthe enjoyment of the people a wealth of natural \\nbeauty expressed in such things as trees, wild- \\nflowers, ferns, birds, mammals and other animals. \\nand in the fine geological exposures which the \\npark ravines and gorges afford. \\nSince 1925 the Cleveland Museum of Natural \\nHistory, in cooperation with the Cleveland Metro- \\npolitan Park Board, has engaged in an ever- \\nexpanding program of popular nature education \\nin these park reservations. Nature Trails have \\nbeen set up and operated in widely separated \\nareas. Labeled Wildflower Trails have been \\nmade a feature of the early spring season. Early \\nSunday morning Bird Walks in spring, and Tree \\nWalks, Geology Walks and Mushroom Walks in \\nautumn have attracted many thousands of people. \\nDuring the summer, this educational program \\nrevolves about three Trailside Museum buildings, \\neach in a different, but characteristic natural \\nenvironment. Each is dedicated to the popular \\nicterpretation of its own surroundings. One of \\nthese buildings is in the midst of a climax forest \\nof beech and sugar maple. Another, on the banks \\nof Rocky River, is surrounded by a he example \\nof the flood-plain forest of northern Ohio. The \\nthird occupies a position adjacent to the oak and \\nhickory forest of the drier ridges. Thus the story \\nthat each Trailside hiuseum has to tell, is differ- \\nent from that of the others. \\nThese museums come into active operation in spring with a week-end program devoted to wild- \\nflowers, niigrating birds, and the awakening \\nvegetation. During the summer they are open \\ndaily, each with a resident Trailside Naturalist in \\ncharge. In autumn the program is again a week- \\nend affair devoted to forest fruits, falling leaves \\nand nature’s preparations for winter. During the \\nwinter. at one building, a Sunday afternoon pro- \\ngram featuring trees in winter, winter birds, and \\nanimal tracks in the snow is maintained. \\nTrailside talks, Sunday afternoon lectures, chil- \\ndren’s nature clubs, and guided trips, are regular \\nfeatures of these museum programs. The museum \\nexhibits ate all interpretative of the surrounding \\nforests and their bird and animal life. \\nFor the science teacher these Museuni pro- \\ngrams in the Cleveland Metropolitan Parks offer \\nan exceptional opportunity not only for the \\nacquisition of knowledge hut for actual participa- \\ntion in leadership. \\nIn addition to the more or less informal educa- \\ntional program, the Park Naturalist has for five \\nsuccessive years led a course in the Western \\nReserve University’s Summer Session in the \\nNatural History of the Cleveland Region, based \\nlargely on field work in the Metropolitan Parks. \\nThis class is an excellent example of successful \\neducational cooperation between three important \\nCleveland agencies-Western Reserve University, \\nThe Cleveland Museum of Natural History, and \\nthe Cleveland Metropolitan Park Board. Its ses- \\nsions have always been attractive to science \\nteachers and others who are anxious to increase \\nt!ieir familiarity with the natural resources of \\nthe region and gain a working knowledge of the \\necology of the park forests. \\nARTHUR B.

She was always active at the \\nnational meetings of the Society and provided an \\naggressive leadership where this was needed in \\nits national affiliations. \\nShe deemed it desirable to retire from this \\nparticular work because of other professional \\nobligations, but in token of her service, a very \\nconsiderable following of the Society felt that she \\nshould be the organization’s new president.

Some of our readers have experi- \\nenced the great joy and value of receiving \\ndirectly from him something oE liis fine \\nphilosophy of science education. \\nIn accepting the award, by Proxy, hlr. \\nWhitsit true to his usual niodesty sent a \\nletter in which he shared his honor with \\nother members of the group. The last \\nthree paragraphs of liis letter express SO \\nwell his basic pliilosophy of science teach- \\ning that we quote them. \\nIf circumstances had allowed ine to be present \\non this occasion, I would undoubtedly here yield \\nto a temptation to state to many newer teachers, \\nwhom I did not have the pleasure of knowing, \\nwhat it is that I tried, and still try, to stand for. \\nFirst that, far more than factual matter, the \\nproper objective in all secondary education should \\nbe habits, attitudes arid ideals, whatever the sub- \\nject. Second, that since we can find very little \\nin print as to what the significant habits, attitudes \\nand ideals of science are, it is the duty of every \\nteacher who hopes to be a teacher, to observe and \\nspeculate until he feels he has the beginnings of \\nknowledge in this matter. \\nI would probably also be quite unable to resist \\nsaying on the point, ‘$0 often raised when I was \\nin discussion of educational objectives, as to \\nwhether or not such things as habits, attitudes \\nand ideals are teachable things, that recent events \\nhave thrown much light on the matter.

In tlie first two chapters, Harry S. \\nGantlers traces the historical developnient and \\ndescrihes the present organization of the all- \\nuniversity program. ’The curious system of \\n“dual” ~xofe~sorships and registration, according \\nto which professors lioltl raak and students are \\nformally enrolled in the School of Education and \\none crtlier university school of their choice, re- \\nceives attentimi in Chapter 111 by Roy A.

Ralph E. Strebel then goes into the \\ncontrihutioris of the institutional teacher place- \\nment bureau. One of the important features of \\nthis whole setup is the close integration of all its \\nconstituent parts.

The belligerents look to science to \\nfurnish the primary means both of offense and \\nof defense. Success or failure in applying scien- \\ntific knowledge effectively is likely to shift the \\nbalance toward victory or defeat. In total war- \\nfare, in which remote hamlets may at an,y mo- \\nment become parts of the firing line, and in \\nwhich civilians far from the actual combat zones \\nmay share with the armed forces the dangers of \\nagony and sudden death, scientific knowledge as \\npart of the equipment of everybody becomes of \\nparamount importance. Children, as well as \\nadults need to be given definite scientific training \\nin order that they may be able to make definite \\npractical contributions to the total war effort on \\nwhich survival depends. \\nProminent among the areas which may well \\nbe stressed in the elementary-science program \\nare food and diet, conservation, personal and \\ncommunity health, safety and first aid. Cooper- \\nation in the elimination of waste and in the pre- \\nvention of the loss of foods and other valuable \\nessentials can be secured only when children, as \\nwell as their parents, possess the scientific knowl- \\nedge upon which such phases of conservation are \\nbased. A scientific knowledge of balanced diet, \\nfood substitutes, sanitation, and personal and \\ncommunity hygiene are or may soon become of \\ngrim significance to all but the very young as \\nwell as to the old. The ability to provide and \\nsecure safety from wartime hazards become \\nmatters of immediate and primary importance to \\neverybody, irrespective of age or socio-economic \\nconditions. All these and other aspects of science \\nbecome essential parts of the work of the: ele- \\nmentary school. \\nIn such an emergency as the present one, the \\nelementary teacher is subjected to many influ- \\nences which tend to cause her to construct units \\nand to institute activities of science which are \\nbased chiefly, if not wholly, upon immediate and \\nimminent “practical” considerations. She is en- \\ncouraged to teach as quickly and as effectively \\nas possible the facts and skills dealing with pres- \\nent and possible future emergencies related to \\nthe preservation of life. She is influenced to \\nplace primary emphasis upon what and hozu, \\nrather than upon why. Consequently the memo- \\nrization of facts and skills is likely to become \\nthe primary, if not the only, goal of w-ork in \\nelementary science ; reflective thinking is likely \\nto become more or less an incidental or an acci- \\ndental part of the course. \\nContrary to coinmoil opinion and in contrast \\nwith common practices, the pressing urges of wartime should provide a means to a broader \\nrather than a narrower teaching. The stress of \\nconflict which the children must inevitably ex- \\nperience, vicariously if not actually, provides an \\nunusually strong and effective motivation for \\nwork in science. Such motivation sustains the \\nchildren’s efforts to learn scientific content which \\nmay now or later contribute substantially toward \\nwinning the war and toward winning through \\nthe post-war period. Activities and materials \\nmust be determined with unusual care. It is \\nessential, of course, that the children emerge \\nfrom their study of the various units with an \\neffective command of the desired special factual \\nknowledges and skills. But these facts and skills, \\nimportant as they unquestionably are, should \\nnot be final ends in themselves. They should be \\nmade the means of promoting the broader objec- \\ntives of science teaching. Facts- should be made \\nto contribute to an understailding of those im- \\nportant principles of science which underlie the \\ncontent of elementary science and which are \\nselected as being especially appropriate for chil- \\ndren in wartime. Thus while pupils are learning \\nwhat they should eat, how to grow foods, how to \\nmaintain proper sanitation, and (the older ones, \\nat least) how to apply first aid, they should also \\nlearn the underlying reasons why the practices \\nadvocated and taught are sound. They should \\nbe led beyond the mere facts and skills to both \\nan understanding and a reasonable facility in the \\nuse of such elements of scientific method as rais- \\ning problems, proposing ways to solve them, \\ngathering data leading to their solution, making \\ngood and testing inferences, and all the rest. \\nWhile the children are gaining the essential war- \\ntime knowledges and skills they should also be \\nmaking progress toward the acquiring of such \\nscientific attitudes as the willingness to weigh \\nand evaluate facts, the willingness to listen with \\nan open mind to the ideas and opinions of others, \\nthe willingness to resist the temptation to leap \\nto conclusions not supported by facts, the unwill- \\ningness to repeat rumors and other statements \\nnot supported by facts, and the like. In other \\nwords, the ultimate objectives of elementary \\nscience remain the same in wartime as in peace- \\ntime; only the activities and materials contribut- \\ning to these ultimate objectives change in ways \\nappropriate to existing and potential emergencies. \\nIf elementary teachers in developing work in \\nscience keep clearly before themselves such im- \\nportant objectives of science teaching as devel- \\noping ability and skill in reflective thinking, \\ninculcating scientific attitudes, and effecting a \\nbroadening understanding of scientific principles, \\nthen the activities appropriate to wartime can \\nbe made to contribute substantially and construc- \\ntively to whatever needs may now or later arise. \\nFRANCIS D. CURTIS \\nU?riuei-sity of hIichigaik. \\n204 DEC., 19421 EDITORIALS AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS 205 \\nSCIENCE IN RELATION TO THE CHILD \\nAND HIS COMMUNITY \\nOne of our greatest concerns today is the edu- \\ncation of our young children, those youngest \\nparticipators in the affairs of any community. \\nIt is only recently that educators have realized \\nthat the school life of a child is only a part of \\nhis whole life. The school is beginning to reach \\nout to give service to the total community, and \\nis in turn beginning to value the service which \\nthe community might give to it. We are at last \\naccepting and using the contributions of green- \\ngrocers, florists, railwaymen, telegraphers, police- \\nmen, doctors, postmen, street-cleaners and \\nparents. We have been very slow to recognize \\nthe fact that they can help in the education of \\nchildren. This has not been true of children. \\nThey have been wiser than we. \\nChildren have always lived in the larger com- \\nmunity. Children have always learned from the \\ncommunity. Children have been slow to bring \\nthe community into the classroom, probably be- \\ncause we have only put the school in the com- \\nmunity, and have done little to make it a part \\nof the community. \\n.4 consideration of possible experiences from \\nthe two areas “Conditions Necessary to Life” \\nand “Living Things” gives evidence that we can \\ndo much to help a young child understand his \\nenvironment. What things are necessary for the \\nsuccessful growth of plants? Do animals need \\nthe same growth conditions as plants i Further- \\nmore. do all animals live well under the same \\nconditions ? These questions may be investigated \\nby children with the help of a classroom teacher. \\nEmphasis is to be placed on the word investi- \\ngate. since it is real investigation and not mere \\nreading about a question that is necessary. \\nYoung children learn much from walks around \\ntheir community at various times during the year \\nin order to notice the growth of plants at a \\ntime when there is ample water, light and heat \\nand at a time when there is less light and heat \\nand little except frozen water. They learn much \\nas they care for animals at school and in their \\nhomes. How are baby mice cared for so that \\nthey will grow up to be strong and healthy? \\nHow can a puppy be kept clean and lively? \\nWhat do human babies need for proper growth? \\nHow can children help to care for themselves \\nso that they will grow up to be strong, healthy \\nmen and women? In solving such problems, \\nvarious experiences should be used such as read- \\ning for facts, carrying on experiments, asking \\nquestions of and checking with community \\nauthorities on such matters. \\nMaterials from the area which we might call \\n“Physical and Chemical Forces” also aid in en- \\nlarging a child‘s background and understanding \\nExperiences dealing with magnetism and elec- \\ntricity may be understood by both six and eleven \\nyear olds. The very young child may use a \\nmagnet merely as a toy at first. Later he begins \\nto experiment with it. What things will a mag- net pick up-a small metal automobile, a piece \\nof crayon, a paper clip, a thumbtack? Then he \\nmay decide that a magnet attracts metallic ob- \\njects. Later he may refine his experimenting \\nby testing only metal objects such as dimes, \\npennies, nickels, paper clips, thumbtacks and \\nnails. The conclusion does not have to be \\ntaught to children, nor do they have to read it \\nfrom a book. They live through an experience \\nand come to a conclusion. A later and very \\nnecessary step is the checking of the conclusion \\nwith some reliable source, either a book or an \\nauthority in the field. \\nThe older child is capable of further progress \\nin the field of magnetism and electricity. He is \\nable to experiment with making electric circuits. \\nHe finds that they must be complete. He dis- \\ncovers which things conduct and which do not \\nconluct electricity. He learns how electromag- \\nnets are used in the telegraph, the telephone and \\nthe radio. Most children who have been allowed \\nto work freely with such materials are fasci- \\nnated by them. In addition to the valuable ex- \\nperience of being able to work out a problem, \\nthey also begin to appreciate the contributions \\nof many people to society. A cultured teacher \\nwill be able to lead children toward a fuller \\nappreciation of the ways in which radios, tele- \\ngraphs and telephones are used by the community. \\nWhere are the instruments made; how many \\npeople aid in their daily operation? It would \\nprobably be unwise to try to point out the rela- \\ntionship of science to society at every point. \\nBut it is desirable that children better under- \\nstand the community contributions of as many \\npeople as possible. \\nA real understanding of some of the sun- \\nearth-moon relationships also is of assistance in \\ngaining an understanding of the total com- \\nmunity. We must place ourselves as members, \\npot only of our village or city community but \\nof our world and solar system community. How \\nis it that the moon and sun can materially affect \\nshipping? What does the sun have to do with \\nthe change of seasons. with day and night? \\nPerhaps a more complete knowledge of our \\nenvironment would give us a more real feeling \\nof belonging to it and of being, in part, respon- \\nsible for the best use of it. \\nPerhaps the most important science-community \\nrelationships may be pointed out in a study of \\nthe earth and its resources and the control of \\nthese resources. A voting citizen should under- \\nstand the natural resources of this country. He \\nmight well begin to gain this understandsing as \\na child. What is oil; what is coal? Will the \\noil supply last much longer; what about the \\ncoal supply? Why cannot they he replenished? \\nDoes top-soil form quickly, or does it take \\nhundreds of years for a six-inch layer to he \\nformed? These are only a few of the vital \\nquestions about wh3ich our present six-year-olds \\nmust hold an opinion in some fifteen years. Our \\neleven-year-olds should have the facts with \\nwhich to form their opinion in ten more years. \\n 1098237x, 1942, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260512 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Science can contribute to society by \\npointing out a way of thinking. A person who \\n&inks scientifically in regard to a social ques- \\ntion thinks without prejudice. He gathers his \\nevidence, considers his facts, draws his conclu- \\nsion and checks that conclusion as carefully as \\npossible. Children are not born with the ability \\nto solve problems in this manner. They need \\nmuch experience in this field. \\nFinally, we must fully understand thi:; fact \\nwhich science shows us-that we can never be \\nisolated from the larger world community. The \\nprevailing winds know no national bounsdaries, \\nneither do disease organisms. The world is a \\ncommunity, and we are a vital part of it. \\nBy helping young children to solve problems \\nin the best way possible, by helping young chil- \\ndren from the very beginning to feel that they \\nare real and functioning members of t1ie.k im- \\nmediate community, perhaps they and we may be \\nable to evolve a better world community. \\nKATHERINE E.

True, that is not a new idea but it \\nplaces in the hands of the science teachers great \\nresponsibility. Much greater than they have to \\ndate been able to cope with. \\n. Much glib talk about scientific thinking and \\ntoo little actual practice in exercising such think- \\ning has been our weakness. Perhaps it is not \\npossible to. ,instill a scientific habit of thinking \\ninto the mind of a boy or girl. Has any jchool \\nsystem actually tried consistently t.0 do so from \\nthe primary grades through the last year in \\nhigh school? Certainly children do not absorb \\nsuch an attitude by reading about it in the \\npreface of the test, by following a set of direc- \\ntions for doing an experiment or filling in blanks \\nin a work bo.ok. How then do they attain such \\nan attitude? Certainly we can be safe in !;aying \\nthat one way is by being forced to exercise such \\nail nttiftrde day after. doj~. Experience shows that the more real the prob- \\nlems are which boys and girls are attempting to \\nsolve, the more earnestly they attempt to solve \\nthem. Some of the problems relating to the \\nwar are excellent pr.oblems for science classes. \\nPupils all over the country are collecbing paper, \\ncollecting tin, conserving sugar and engaging in \\ndozens of other similar activities. If asked why, \\nit is very likely that a high percentage of them. \\nwould actually know little to answer. \\nIf asked to invesbigate these problems a large \\nmajority would believe the first person who gave \\nthem information. The question of who gives \\nthe information appears important only to a \\nsmall percentage of our pupils. The fact that \\nsources disagree may not even stimulate them \\nto do further investigation unless they are led \\nto do so. It occurs to few indvividuals to evalu- \\nate sources of information. Why? Could it \\nbe because we have not continually urged and \\nrequired thein to do so? \\nThis \\nfact affects every child in our schools in one \\nway or another. The problems concerning the \\nwar are real. Under direction the solving of \\nsome of the problems can call from pupils the \\nbest they can offer in thinking. \\nCan it be that this is an opportunity for de- \\nparting from the course of study into solving \\nproblems of imiliediate concern to pupils? Is \\nit a time for placing more stress on the valid,ity \\nof the source of information than on the remem- \\nhering of unimportant details of facts-a time \\nfor stressing the importance of being open \\nminded-a time for learning to analyze data \\ncarefully and accurately? \\nDay after day, week after week, year after \\nyear, through our science classes there must be \\nconstant stress on the elements that go to make \\nup a soientific way of looking at things. A \\njustification for some of the science subject \\nmatter we teach is difficult. The development \\nof a truly scientific attitude is in itself a justifi- \\ncation for any number of hours spent in the \\nscience classes of our schools.

In other words, the purpose of \\nscience education today is simply what should \\nbe the purpose of ALL education. Science is \\nmerely one of the great, unjiversal tools by which \\nthe child today may be guided into a richer and \\nmore abundant life. \\nEvery child is born with an innate interest in \\nthose things which exist in his immediate en- \\n 1098237x, 1942, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260512 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

This interest develops in a \\ndefinite manner as the child develops and is evi- \\ndenced by the specific nature of the questions \\nwhich he asks. There is probably no other field \\nin the elementary school program where there \\nis so much vital interest, on the part of the \\nchild, WAITING to be developed, than there is \\nin the field of science. It is the wise teacher \\nwho recognizes this fact and makes the most of \\nthe opportunities offered. It is also the wise \\nteacher who recognizes and understands the \\nvarious levels of interest among children and who \\nutilizes the things of soience to enrich the ex- \\nperiences of the boys and girls who come under \\nher guidance. The teacher who fails to take \\nadvantage of these opportunities fails society. \\nSociety today is in a confused and chaotic \\ncondition. Avarice, greed, corrupt politics and a \\nlack of understanding among peoples are blamed, \\nbut only in part. Educators should have recog- \\nnized LONG AGO that science is an universal \\ntool. Teachers should have been trained in the \\nuse of the scientific method. Children should \\nhave been taught to think scientifically. Instead, \\nthe scientific method, the way of scientific think- \\ning, and the things of science have been shunned \\nas something strange, mysterious and compre- \\nhensive only to the specialist. The result is that \\nscience, as such, has outstripped the layman by \\ncenturies. It has left him a helpless and bewil- \\ndered figure in the center of a scientific age! \\nIt is the duty of educators today to accept the \\nimportance of science. We should foster and \\nencourage those efforts which have been made to \\nplace science in the elementary school program. \\nWhy should not science be treated as a funda- \\nmental subject in elementary education? Is it \\nnot equally as important as readin’, writin’ and \\n’rithmetic? As Dr. Craig once said, “In a very \\nreal sense children have the RIGHT to demand \\nthat science be a part of their education because \\nit is so much a part of their lives.” Until sci- \\nence in the elementary schools is given a funda- \\nmental, tool position in the curriculum the aver- \\nage person will become a bewildered creature in \\nthe midst of an ever changing environment. \\nThere is no phase of elementary school science \\nwhich cannot enrich experiences in the lives of \\nchildren. There is no phase which does not con- \\ntribute, in some way, to the development of \\nabilities in democratic living. Raturally, the \\nscience program must be in the hands of com- \\npetent and understanding instructors. \\nThere is a demonstration of just such an in- \\nstance, at present, in one school of a large city \\nsystem. The school is a small one of five \\nteachers. It is located 011 the fringe of the \\ncity, in the heart of a new district which has \\nbeen settled. largely, by the peasant type of \\nforeigner. December seventh brought trouble, \\ntemporarily, to this district but the wisdom of \\nthe head teacher of the school and a private \\nsession with young Japan finally restored unity. \\nShortly thereafter, instructions for victory gar- dens were issued. The head teacher grasped the \\nopportunity which this offered. The surplus yard \\nspace was set aside and the entire school plunged \\nheart and soul into “ventures with vegetables \\nfor vitamines for victory.” \\nSoil condition was the first problem to con- \\nfront the children. The soil of this district is \\ndifficult to work and lacks many qualities for \\nrichness. When this problem was solved the \\nchildren had met with varied experiences. They \\nhad been guided in meaningful interpretations of \\nthese experiences. The result is that they under- \\nstand many of the important concepts of science \\nwhich are related to soil formation, fertilization, \\ndrainage, animal life in the soil, and so on. \\nThe second problem was what seeds and \\nplants to use which would mature before school \\ncloses in June. Through guidance, choices were \\nmade and the work proceeded. Experiences with \\nvarieties of seeds and plants followed. The re- \\nsult will be, as the garden develops, the under- \\nstanding of science concepts which are related \\nto the ways in which new plants are produced, \\nhow plants grow, weed problems, moisture and \\ncultivation, function of the flower, nutrition, \\nand so on. \\nIn addition to the science implications involved, \\nthe garden activity has made striking contribu- \\ntions to a democratic way of life. For example. \\nyoung Japan, so recently obnoxious, was chosen \\nas leader of one of the garden groups and is \\nacting adviser to all the groups because he knows \\nso much about gardening! The families of the \\ncommunity are interested and have shown it bq \\ndonating quantities of old fashioned fertilizer ! \\nThe problem boy of the school voluntarily chose \\nto he!p the kindergarten. He has taken full \\ncharge of their small garden. The larger boys \\noffered to prepare and fence the plot for the \\nprimary children before they joined their own \\ngroups. What greater evidence could there be \\nthat all are working for the common good? \\nThe competent teachers in this school have \\nrecognized the fact that science can be a funda- \\nmental tool. The children are learning to think \\nscientifically. The scientific method is the “right \\nway to work.” The happy spirit of the school \\nhas spread to the homes and has developed a \\ngroup interest. If the children of this com- \\nmunity receive the same guidance throughout the \\nremainder of their school lives, few of them \\nwill become bewildered figures 111 an ever chang- \\ning environment ! \\nESTHER L.

Therefore school is \\nbeing held in most of the army training camps \\nand far more time than should be needed is being \\nused in training more workers for industry. \\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with these \\nyoung people; it is just that they were deprived \\nof a deservedly adequate education when they \\nwent through the pubbic schools. \\nThe curriculum in our public schools has been \\nrevised continuously during the past fifteen. years, \\nhut its basic character has changed little. Dur- \\ning this time science has made tremendous strides \\nand the discover,ies have found their wa.y into \\nevery branch of industry and personal life. It is \\nnow almost impossible to work and enjoy life in \\nthis country without associating closely with sci- \\nence and the products of science. Yet science in \\nmost of our school systems still has a relatively \\nunimportant place in the curriculum. The aver- \\nace child gets little instruction in science--in the \\nthinqs that comprise his environment-u:ntil he \\nreaches the last year of the junior high school \\nand then a foreign language, public sp’eaking, \\nmusic, or art may crowd science out of his pro- \\ngram. Only a small percentage of students take \\nanv high school science other than biology. \\nSmall wonder is it then that the gap between \\nTcience (and industry) and the average citizen \\nhas become so great that the nation has WPA \\nand relief rolls at a time when more workers \\nare needed desperately. \\nI helieve that this situation is now due to be \\nremedied. Schools are going to have to teach \\npupils the skills needed in everyday living and \\nthe information about this natural and man-made \\nworld that a person must have to compete suc- \\ncessfully for a living in our industrial civiliza- \\ntion. This means that science instruction. \\nespecially in the elementary and junior high \\nschools, has a good chance of getting the con- \\nsideration it deserves. A comparatively small \\nxroup of foresighted educators have for years \\nbeen pointing out the essential contribution of \\nelementary science to the program of instruction \\nin the elementary school, and it now appears that \\ntheir advice is to be heeded, somewhat belatedly \\nhut not irreparably so. \\nOf course, this calls for some joy, but far \\nmore work than joy is needed among the pro- \\nmoters of elementary science. Many problems \\nstill need to be solved and essential truths to be \\ndetermined if elementary science is to justify its \\ninclusion in the basic elementary curriculum. \\nFor instance, more information is needed on the \\nspecific outcomes that can he achieved in each \\nTrade level by science instruction. Fortunately \\na sub-committee report on this subject, prepared \\nunder the direction of W. C. Croxton ‘of the \\nNational Committee on Science Teaching, has \\nheen issued. But it will not be the last word; \\nmore work is needed. More work is also needed on the in-service \\ntraining of teachers for elementary science. The \\nthousands of elementary teachers now in our \\nschools know little about elementary science or \\nhow to teach it effectively, and they must be \\ntrained in an easy, inexpensive manner. \\nMore information is needed on effective pro- \\ncedures for guiding pupils to form desirable \\nhabits and attitudes as they attend school. Much \\nof this is in the field of elementary science since \\nmany of the habits and attitudes have to do \\nwith the pupil’s reactions to his environment and \\nto his own body. The status of health education \\nin our schools is deplorable, and elementary \\nscience can do much to improve it. \\nThese and other pressing problems cannot be \\nsolved by college professors and administrators \\nalone-much must come from the classroom \\nteachers of America. We must encourage good \\nteachers everywhere to report their successful \\ntechniques so that they can be used by others \\nA sub-committee of the National Committee on \\nScience Teaching, headed by Mr. Emil Massel \\nof the Detroit Public Schools, is now collecting \\nsuch data for publication. The sub-committee \\ndeserves your assistance. \\nThese times call for hard work and realistic \\nthinking on these and other prohlems in elemen- \\ntary science. With such work we not onl) \\npromote elementary science, but we aid materiall) \\nin making America’s mass education endeavor a \\nsuccess.

There was a pile of black dirt \\non each side of the walk to Mr. Thomas’ house. \\nThe children watched him “spread the black \\ndirt all over the top of his yard in a thick layer,” \\nthey watched him “sprinkle fertilizer from a big \\nbag all over and rake it into the dirt.” They \\nlearned all about the fertilizer. They watched \\nhim sprinkle the lawn several times each day \\n“to keep it moist.” On Thursday they saw him \\nsow his grass seed. WIany were the questions \\nraised as he covered the whole lawn with \\n“gunny sacks” and “large cardboards” before he \\nsprinkled it again “with the hose.” \\nThere were many hypotheses suggested as rea- \\nsons for the covering, but Mr. Thomas himself \\napproved of the following three: \\nTo keep birds (sparrows) from eating the seeds \\nTo help keep the ground warm at night \\nTo keep the seeds from blowing or washing \\naway. \\n-4fter eight clays of faithful watering Mr. \\nThomas carefully uncovered the lawn. It looked \\n“black” from the schoolroom windows, but “per- \\nhaps he could see something that we could not” \\nmas the suggestion of one child. \\nnJas not this remark indicative of suspended \\njudgment ? \\nThe class, on an inspection tour, discovered \\nemerging from the new lawn both tiny clover \\nleaves and green shoots of grass. They con- \\ncluded from this that Mr. Thomas was right in \\nremoving the cover. “He wouldn’t want the \\ncover to make it (the lawn) yellow.” “The sun \\nmakes grass green.” \\nTwo days later the children viewed from their \\nwindows a green lawn which they said “would \\nmake a thick green carpet over the whole yard.” \\nNow Mr. Thomas was putting “a string fence \\nall around his yard” which children interpreted \\nas saying to them: “Please be careful and let \\nme grow.” \\nNow children thought they knew how to make \\na lawn. They would tell their fathers how and \\nhelp them fix their own lawns \\nBehavior on succeeding field trips in the \\nneighborhood indicated that the children had \\ngained more respect for lawns in the community. \\nA fourth grade group of children studying \\nSwitzerland were experimenting to learn more \\nabout erosion by pouring water down the side of \\na hill in their sand table. They saw the water \\nwash a gully and drop sand on the flat below \\nforming a delta. They summarized their learn- \\nings in this way: \\n“Water can cut through rocks. “Some streams cut deep valleys. \\n“Water is very strong when it flows swiftly \\n“Water steals sand and pebbles from one place \\n“Water is always leveling the land.” \\nSome child called the delta, “the Netherlands.” \\nThe teacher guide transferred interest to a \\nphysical map of Europe and asked the children \\nif John had been correct in saying that the \\nNetherlands was the delta of the Nile. The \\nchildren eagerly studied the map and verified \\nthere the learnings they had gained from experi- \\nmentation at the sand table. and carries soil. \\nand carries them to other places. \\nThese are illustrations of children’s way of \\nlearning when and if they are carefully and \\nthoughtfully guided by a skilled teacher. It is \\nthe scientific way of learning charged with the \\nreal spirit of search for truth. \\nIf and when the skilled teacher helps children \\nto see opportunities for application of their \\nlearnings to new situations the children will \\ngrow in the development of habits of reflective \\nthinking and in scientific attitudes. \\nThe classrooms of the elementary school offer \\nnumerous opportunities for this type of teacher \\nguidance in thinking because children once \\nawakened to the world of nature and scientific \\ndevelopment about them constantly present ques- \\ntions and problems of great variety relative to \\nlife and living. \\nThe teacher must be able to help the children \\nsimplify their problems by reducing their some- \\ntimes very complex statements to two or more \\nelemental questions. \\nChildren at all elementary levels are able to \\ndraw conclusions from data which they them- \\nselves gather as a result of observation, simple \\nexperimentation, reading and in other ways. \\nIn gathering data and in conversational discus- \\nsion relative to their self-initiated problems chil- \\ndren, guided by a democratic teacher, learn to be \\ntolerant of the opinion of others and to weigh \\nevidence very meticulously. The classroom that \\nundertakes such learning situations must be very \\ndemocratic. The children must learn to be co- \\noperative. The teacher must discover the abilities \\nof Mary, Jane, Jim and John and must guide \\nexperiences in such a way that each individual \\nhas a share comparable with his ability. \\nFrom such classrooms the following incidents \\nwere taken : . \\nA group of sixth grade boys, playing ball on \\nschool playgrounds on a Saturday morning were \\nattracted by the peculiar behavior of a killdeer. \\nIn accordance with habit they investigated and \\nfound a nest full of eggs. The ball diamond \\nwas moved to a more distant part of the school \\ngrounds. The nest was guarded by a barricade \\nof stones and scraps and a note advising “other \\nfellows to let the birds have a chance to raise \\ntheir babies” was weighted down in plain sight \\nin the barricade. \\n 1098237x, 1942, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260512 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Consequently, several \\ninformal meetings of interested people have \\nbeen initiated by Professor K. Lark-Horo- \\nvitz, of Purdue University. These meet- \\nings have been attended by mathematicians, \\nphysicists, chemists, biologists, and educa- \\ntionists. In April, 1931, the Cooperative \\nCommittee on Science Teaching was \\ncreated by representatives of several \\nscientific societies. Robert J.

Most teachers begin their work \\nin small high schools of two hundred or fewer \\nstudents. In such high schools a teacher must \\nteach three or four different subjects. There- \\nfore, a college graduate with highly specialized \\ntraining in a single science is at a disadvantage \\nin securing a position or in his teaching if he is \\nappointed. The Committee hopes to formulate \\na policy to which all the scientific societies can \\nagree and which suits the realities of the teach- \\ning situations. The Committee hopes to make \\nthis study so thorough and its reommendations \\nso practical that its report can be used by cer- \\ntification authorities as a basis for action. \\nThe College Training of Prospective .Science \\nTeachers. The Committee recognizes the diffi- \\nculty of preparing science teachers for such broad \\nteaching assignments as are given to most new \\nteachers. This problem will require careful \\nstudy with the aim of planning a program which \\nwill secure the necessary breadth of science train- \\ning, give adequate opportunity for specializing in \\none science, and provide for professional courses \\nin education as well as a sufficient number of \\ncourses for general culture. \\nExploratory Studies of the Secoizdary-School \\nScience Ciirricziliirn thi-ozcyh Workshops and \\nConfer-emes. The Committee hopes to stimulate \\nthe science departments of a number of colleges \\nand universities to bring secondary-school teach- \\ners to their campuses for cooperative work on \\ntheir educational problems. Out of workshops \\nand conferences held at colleges and universities \\nwould probably come plans for improved science \\ncourses. These activities would provide good \\nin-service training for science teachers and would \\nenable the secondary-school teachers to make \\ntheir problems and their points of view evident \\nto the college scientists. \\nProblems of State or Local Agencies Needing \\nthe Setvices of Edzicational Consultants on Ques- \\ntions Pertaining to Science Teaching. The \\nCommittee offers its services as a consultant to \\nstate or local agencies working on problems per- \\ntaining to science teaching. The Committee may \\nthus provide direct connection between such \\nagencies and the societies represented on the \\nCommittee. For example, the Committee might \\nbecome associated in a curriculum study in some \\nstate, cooperating with the state department of \\neducation and the college and secondary-school \\nscience teachers of that state. The results of \\nsuch a project might prove valuable to other \\nstates. \\nMeetings. Meetings have been held in Chi- \\ncago, April 19, 1941, and November 22, 1941. \\nFOR THE SEVENTEENTH TIRdE \\nThat Science Teacher Scout, Hanor \\nA. Webb, has given US another excellent \\nlist of books under the title, “The High School Science Library for 194041,” in \\nthe November issue of Peabody Journal \\nof Education. This annual list is the latest \\nin the series which began in 1925-26. \\nWhile no mention of reprints accompanies \\nthe bibliography, we trust that the author \\nwill provide reprints at the low cost made \\non the lists of previous years. \\nThe usual cumulative price groups are \\nindicated for the titles. The range of the \\nreference books is from the grades to junior \\ncollege level. High school textbooks in \\nscience are given in a separate section of \\nthe bibliography. A very brief annota- \\ntion accompanies each title. \\nMay we express to the author the appre- \\nciation of our readers and ourselves for \\nthe service which he has contributed and \\nis contributing through this time-consum- \\ning, but interesting we trust, activity. \\nSCIENCE CAN HELP \\nAttention is called here to the brief arti- \\ncle by Pressey appearing in this issue. It \\ncontains a series of excellent suggestions \\nregarding areas of education for defense in \\nwhich science teachers at all school and \\njunior college levels may contribute scien- \\ntific understanding and conscious tech- \\nniques of scientific procedure in intelligent \\nchoice of action during the emergency. \\nIt is hoped that our readers will send \\nus other articles dealing with the potential- \\nities of science for instruction in defense \\nand particularly dealing with experiences, \\nactivities, and “units” which they have \\nfound to yield desirable outcomes in this \\narea. \\nIn this connection, the national interest \\nbeing shown in nutrition education should \\nchallenge science teachers. The National \\nNutrition Conference was held last Octo- \\nber to discuss nutrition education as an \\nintegral part of the school program. \\nScience teachers will look forward to the \\nfuture plans and reports of the group. We \\nare prompted to wonder if the science \\nteachers and supervisors have been invited \\nto contribute to the group.

Now, while \\ngreater and greater resolutions are at- \\ntempted through improvements, comes the \\ninteresting story of three dimensional, or \\nstereoscopic, micrographs produced by a \\nnew photographic technique. \\nMembers of the American Association \\nfor the Advancement of Science, meeting \\nin annual session at Dallas, Texas, heard \\nthe new technique described by Drs. \\nZworykin and Hillier of the R.C.A. Lab- \\noratories. It will be recalled that these \\ntwo men were among the first in America \\nto contribute to the developnlent of the \\nelectron microscope, Dr. Zworylcin at the \\nR.C.A. Laboratories and Dr. Hillier, with \\nothers, at Toronto University. \\nFrom a recent release by the R.C.A. \\nManufacturing Company, Inc., at Camden, \\nNew Jersey, we quote certain excerpts de- \\nscribing the new technique, its revelations \\nand some of its potential applications. \\nWith this new method, the scientists reported, \\nthe electron microscope, which recently made it \\npossible to photograph the influenza virus for \\nthe first time, becomes a more powerful tool for \\nuse in science and industry. \\nSince development of the electron microscope \\nfor commercial use little more than a year ago by R.C.A. scientists have .been looking at tiny \\nobjects that lie far beyond the range of the light \\nmicroscope. But these objects, many of them \\nmagnified as much as 100,000 times, have been \\nseen in a flat plane only. Now, with the new \\ntechnique, substantially more information as to \\nover-all size and shape can be obtained. \\nScientific investigation in such fields as biology, \\nbacteriology, medicine, chemistry, ceramics, and \\nmetallurgy are expected to benefit greatly from \\nthe improved observation. Information as to the \\nsize and shape of infinitesimally small objects, it \\nis pointed out, leads to new knowledge of their \\ndistribution and behavior. The knowledge, in \\nturn, provides the basis for the development by \\nscience and industry of new and useful practices, \\nservices, and products. \\nThe electron microscope is especially well- \\nsuited to the preparation of three-dimensional pic- \\ntures, Zworykin and Hillier said, because of its \\nremarkable depth of focus. Two pictures of the \\nobject are taken in succession, the object in a \\nspecial holder being tilted through a fixed small \\nangle with respect to the instrument’s axis, first \\nin one direction and then in the opposite. When \\nthe two pictures so obtained are placed in an \\nordinary stereoscope, the object, greatly magni- \\nfied, appears in its proper space relationship. \\nAided to some extent by the new stereoscope \\ntechnique, Drs. A. Glenn Richards, Jr., of the \\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, and Thomas F. \\nAnderson, R.C.A. Fellow of the National Research \\nCouncil, are making special studies of insects \\nwith the electron microscope. Results of this \\nresearch were reported to the Association in \\nanother joint paper. \\nA factor contributing to the success of this \\nresearch was the development for the first time \\nof a technique for cutting sections (slices) of \\nsolid material sufficiently thin for study in the \\nelectron microscope. (0.1 micron or four \\nmillionths of an inch thick.) \\nA study of electron micrographs of insect \\nstructures of cockroach and mosquito larvae was \\nmade to throw light on how insects breathe (ob- \\ntain oxygen) through their skin and how certain \\ninsecticides kill insects by coming in contact with \\ntheir skin. \\nCockroach skin was found to be made up of \\nmany layers, including a thin outer layer of con- \\ntinuous water-repellent material, a thicker con- \\ntinuous layer, and a thick layer of laminated \\nmaterial through which passed tiny pore canels \\nhaving a helical shape. These canals averaged \\nabout 0.15 microns (6 millionths of an inch) in \\ndiameter. While theory had previously indicated \\nthe probable exislance of these canals, their pres- \\nence is thus confirmed for the first time with \\nthe aid of the electron microscope. A single \\ncockroach has about two billion of these canals. \\nMosquito larvae skin is very thin-about one \\ntwenty-five thousandths of an inch thick-and is \\ncontinuous, consisting of a very thin outer layer \\n 1098237x, 1942, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260109 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Since both cockroach \\nand mosquito skin have layers with no holes in \\nthem, it is concluded that air and possibly other \\nsubstances must diffuse through these solid layers. \\nAnother way in which insects obtain oxygen \\nis through a branching system of thin walled \\ntubes called trachez which communicate with \\nmost parts of the body. These tubes somewhat \\nresemble the bronchial tubes of the human \\nanatomy. \\nIn presenting their findings on insects, the two \\nscientists showed electron micrographs of insect \\ntrachez, butterfly scales, and beetle elytra to \\nillustrate the minute anatomical details to be \\nfound in insect materials. They said that details \\nreach magnitudes of the order of one millionth \\nof a centimeter or less (4 ten millionths of an \\ninch). Included among the micrographs were \\nstereoscopic pictures illustrating three-dimen- \\nsional relationships in insect trachen. \\nThe electron microscope, perfected in the R.C.A. \\nLaboratories, as the result of discoveries made \\niii the development of the R.C.A. all-electronic sys- \\ntem of television, has been in practical use for \\nabout a year. Capable of magnifications up 10 \\n1@@,000 diameters because of its high degree of \\nresolution, the intrument has opened whole new \\nworlds of scientific investigation and industrial \\napplication. \\nDuring 1941, the R.C.A. Manufacturing Com- \\npany built and installed sixteen electron ,micro- \\nscopes for various scientific institutions of the \\ncountry, including the United States Bureau of \\nStandards, Universities and industrial labora- \\ntories. The instruments are being installed only \\nwhere they will have direct usefulness in national \\ndefense. \\nNEEDED EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH \\nIn the December, 1941, issue of the Phi \\nDelta Kappuzz which is devoted to Research \\nin Education, the reader will find, in addi- \\ntion to some excellent articles on the :jtruc- \\nture, trends and reporting of educational \\nresearch, an excellent bibliography on prob- \\nlem suggested for investigation and a \\nchallenging list of topics needing imme- \\ndiate research. The issue also conta.ins a \\nlist of references of practical value to the \\nresearch worker. \\nWhile few items in the bibliographies \\nand list refer specifically to science edu- \\ncation, a numher of them will suggest to \\nthe research worker, teacher, and super- \\nvisor in this field many problems in line \\nwith trends in American Education. EDUCATION IN 1941-1942 \\nLarge numbers are always challenging to \\nmany persons. School officers and teach- \\ners like to know they are engaged in a \\ngreat enterprise.

He has studied \\nalgebra for 1 year and plane geometry for an- \\nother. He has taken 2 years of natural science, \\nincluding an elementary course in general science \\nand another in physics, and he has had 2 years \\nof a foreign language, tither ancient or modern. \\nNow I have mentioned 12 of the 15 units required \\nfor graduation. The rest of his work has been \\ndistributed among elective subjects in the same \\nfields just mentioned, except that if he departed \\nfrom the average course, he may have had 1 \\nyear of industrial arts work and 1 year of type- \\nwriting, bookkeeping, or some other commercial \\nsubject. Having completed such a course in \\nhigh school, he will have taken the subjects \\nrequired for admission to college where, in all \\nprobability, he will continue for 2 additional \\nyears to pursue similar subjects before beginning \\na specialization in some one field. \\nObviously the reference above to “an- \\nother (year) of physics” is given as an \\n 1098237x, 1942, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260109 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

More- \\nover, statistics for the country at large do \\nnot appear to support the statement that \\nthe graduate has taken two years of sci- \\nence. Of course, it is clear that the state- \\nment is meant to give only an approximate \\npicture. Those of us interested in seeing \\nthat science is adequately represented in \\nthe courses pursued by graduates of the \\nsecondary school would be somewhat \\ncheered by a figure of two units in science. \\nUnfortunately for us the figure is probably \\nabout 30 per cent above reality. \\nA HANDBOOK FOR PRE-SERVICE \\nTEACHERS \\nEmphasizing first-hand experiences for \\nstudents being inducted into the teaching \\nprofession, this handboolc represents the \\njoint efforts of a group of students from \\nthe School of Education of the University \\nof Wisconsin, the Director of Laboratory \\nActivities in the basic education courses \\nrequired of all prospective teachers at that \\ninstitution and her graduate assistant. The \\nDirector is Camilla M. Low. \\nThe handbook describes, in one hun- \\ndred twenty pages, the place of laboratory \\nexperiences in the program for teachers, \\nthe laboratory opportunities in the schools \\nof Madison, the laboratory opportunities \\nin the social agencies of Madison, ways of \\nstudying the pupil through the activities, \\ntechniques and findings in the study of the \\ncommunity background of the pupils, es- \\nsentials of group leadership, and many \\npractical and concrete suggestions for par- \\nticipants in the program. \\nThe philosophy of education underlying \\nthe handbook and the nature of activities \\nengaged in by the perspective teachers \\nhighly commend the publication. Here is \\na report largely concerned with the actual \\nexperiences, voluntary and required, of \\nstudent-teachers. It will serve newcomers \\nin student-teaching with a wealth of assist- ance. Teachers of science, “critic” teach- \\ners, and those offering courses for science \\nteachers will gain much by careful exaniin- \\nation of the monograph. \\nJUNIOR COLLEGES \\nThe country’s abnormal situation caused \\nby defense activities has not affected en- \\nrollment in the nation’s 650 junior colleges \\nas severely as had been expected, according \\nto a study just completed by Walter C. \\nEells, executive secretary of the American \\nAssociation of Junior Colleges. \\nThe study reveals that enrollments in \\npublic junior colleges show an average \\ndrop of only 10 per cent from those of last \\nyear, while in private junior colleges there \\nhas been a slight increase of less than one \\nper cent. The change in public junior col- \\nleges may be explained by the fact that \\nthey are for the most part coeducational \\nand therefore affected by the decrease in \\nthe enrollment of men, whereas many pri- \\nvate junior colleges are women’s colleges. \\nOf the public institutions, only 29 re- \\nported an increase, 19 no change, and 139 \\na decrease. Replies ranged from an in- \\ncrease of 40 per cent to a decrease of the \\nsame amount. Of the private institutions, \\n73 reported an increase, 56 no change, and \\n71 a decrease. Replies ranged from an in- \\ncrease of 60 per cent to a decrease of 50 \\nper cent. \\nSeveral institutions which have evening \\n:IS well as day work report a falling off in \\nthe full-time day enrollment but that this \\nis more than made up by the marked in- \\ncrease in evening enrollment on the part \\nof young men now employed in defense \\nindustries during the day. \\nAn interesting change in emphasis of \\nstudies preferred by students is also seen \\nin the replies. Technical, scientific, and \\nshort business courses are in great demand. \\nOne administrator comments : “We notice \\na pronounced swing from the so-called \\ncultural subjects to the scientific and \\nvocational.” \\n 1098237x, 1942, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730260109 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The editors wish to thank \\nall who responded and to assure them that \\ntheir replies are being used as a basis for \\ndeveloping the editorial policy of the \\njournal. \\nThe first question concerned the depart- \\nments proposed by the Committee on Pub- \\nlication. Of these, all save one were ap- \\nproved by more than 88 per cent of the \\nrespondents. The suggested department, \\n“The Science Teacher’s Heritage,” met \\nwith approval from only 64 per cent of \\nthose answering the questionnaire. Acting upon the information thus ob- \\ntained, the Committee plans to present \\nmajor articles in the areas of “Science \\nToday,” and “Science in the Community” ; \\nto publish brief papers under the general \\nheading, “Teaching Reports and Sugges- \\ntions” ; to maintain and develop the “Re- \\nviews and Abstracts” department, and to \\ninaugurate departments entitled “Research \\nin Science Teaching” and “Significant \\nTrends in Education.” The new depart- \\nments will appear in the next issue oi the \\njournal. Dr. Francis D. Curtis, Professor \\nof Secondary Education, University of \\nMichigan, has agreed to act as editor of \\nthe department of Research in Science \\nTeaching. The department of Significant \\nTrends in Education will be edited by Dr. \\nR. Will Burnett, Assistant Professor of \\nEducation, Stanford University. \\n289 [VOL. 28, No. 5 290 SCIENCE EDUCATION \\nTwo items on the questionnaire dealt \\nspecifically with the matter of Book Re- \\nviews. While there was overwhelming \\nagreement as to the value of reviews, there \\nwas considerable difference of opinion as \\nto the areas that should be covered. The \\nmajority of the respondents favored re- \\nviewing textbooks for elementary and \\nsecondary schools and interpretations of \\nscience for teachers; only a few wanted \\n1 evie\\\\\\\\ s of college textbooks and books on \\neducation. There was almost an even \\ndivision on the question of the nature of \\nthe book reviews: SO per cent favored \\ncritical and detailed reviews; 57 per cent \\nwanted brief notations. Some people, as \\nthe percentages show, asked for both sorts \\nof reviews; to provide both seems to the \\nCommittee, too, to be the best procedure. \\nThe final question dealt with the publi- \\ncation schedule of the journal. lIere, too, \\nthere were differences of opinion. Sixty- \\ntn.0 per cent of the readers, however, con- \\nsidered the present publication dates \\nsatisfactory and thus emboldened the Com- \\nmittee to continue this schedule for the \\ntime being. \\nThe next number of SCIENCE EDUCA- \\nTION to appear will be Number 1 of \\nVolume 29, and will be published in \\nFebruary, 194.5. It will be issued under \\nthe general editorship of Dr. Samuel \\nRalph Powers, Head of the Department \\nof Teaching of Natural Sciences, Teachers \\nCollege, Columbia University. \\n-E. M. M. \\nSIGNIFICANT TRENDS IN \\nEDUCATION \\nThe good science teacher has always \\naccepted and discharged his responsi- \\nbility in keeping abreast of scientific \\nprogress. The chemistry teacher today is \\ngoing beyond his textbook to a considera- \\ntion of the chemistry of thermosets and \\nthermoplastics and to a vision of the world \\nahead. The physics teacher already seeks \\nto incorporate in his work more fully the story of radar and other wartime ad- \\nvances in physical engineering. The \\nbiology teacher is enthusiastic about DDT, \\npenicillin, and similar important incidents \\nin the advance of biological knowledge. \\nBut every science teacher recognizes \\nthat his is a profession in which mastery \\nis compounded of more than technical \\nknowledge and proficiency of a scientific \\norder. Teaching proficiency requires a \\nfundamental grasp of the trends of the \\ntimes, recognition of the basic problems \\nand issues of modern life, understanding \\nof the learning process, and the profes- \\nsional ability to select and organize content \\nand experiences from the fields of science \\nto provide for individual development of \\nyoung people for competence and happi- \\nness in modern living. \\nThe science teacher has an important \\nrole to play in American education. But \\nhe is one of a team composed of certain \\nnon-school research and educational or- \\nganizations and of educational research \\nworkers, administrators, and teachers of \\ndisciplines other than science. Perhaps \\ninore than lie sometimes realizes, what lie \\nteaches and the way in whicli he teaches, \\nare influenced and will continue to be \\nmodified by the broad issues and trends of \\nthe day and the thinking and activities of \\nothers of this professional educational \\nteam. \\nThree examples-varying in scope and \\nsignificance - should sufficiently under- \\nwrite this point. The double laboratory \\nperiod of the laboratory sciences in the \\nschools of San Francisco, California, was \\nabandoned some two years back in favor of \\na single period. The relative advantages \\nof either plan are debatable. The impor- \\ntant point is that the change was made on \\nthe basis of broad educational policy and \\nadministrative expedience ; and without the \\nmature deliberation of the science teachers \\nof that city. Not a big point, perhaps, but \\ninteresting as it reflects the coinnion image \\nof science teachers alert and capable in \\ntheir own fields but insufficiently informed \\n 1098237x, 1944, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730280511 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Pre-induction \\ntraining courses, pre-flight aeronautics, and \\nadjustments in traditional programs of \\nscience courses were made on premises \\nwhich, to many if not most science teach- \\ners, have been totally unclear. The fact \\nthat a few science teachers and represeiita- \\ntives of their organizations were instru- \\nmental in some of these wartime modifica- \\ntions does not alter the fact that tlie \\nmajority of science teachers found it \\nnecessary to accept rather blindly such \\nmodifications as were recommended under \\nprestige auspices or required by their \\nadministrators. \\nA third example is the historical record \\nof changes in objectives and points of view \\nin science teaching; a record which dis- \\ncloses retrospectively that which may con- \\nfidently be anticipated for the future : that \\nscience teaching is inextricably involved in \\nthe policy making and trends of any edu- \\ncational period. Science entered the cur- \\nricula of western schools in part to sup- \\nport, through its interpretation of a \\n~iieclianical universe of order and ration- \\nality, tlie deistic conception of the didactic \\nwriters of the time. The science teachers \\ntaught in this mold. With the advance of \\nthe faculty school of psycliology in tlie \\nnineteenth century tlie aims of science \\nteaching, if not wholly the methods, were \\nmodified in rather short order. For tlie \\npast decade, and continuing at present, the \\ntrend toward a newer conception of a \\nliberal education-coinnionly called general \\neducation, as opposed to an older and \\naristocratic view of liberal education- \\nhas been modifying science education \\nthroughout the country. An examination \\nof modern textbooks, courses of study, and \\nprofessional writings will substantiate the \\nstatement. It is unnecessary to question tlie soundness of this or other basic \\nphilosophies of education. The important \\nthing is that busy science teachers, by and \\nlarge, have not had opportunities to be par- \\nticipants in or even ifzzforwaed reactors to \\nthese formulations of policy. A few lead- \\ners in science education have, it is true, \\nalways been instrumental in tlie develop- \\nment of educational policy. But the one \\nwho really counts-the teacher in the \\nclassroom-has found it difficult to under- \\nstand the forces that have shaped and are \\nshaping the broad alignments of his work. \\nThis lias not been a iiioral fault of the \\nscience-trained teacher. The job of keep- \\ning up with even one aspect of a fieid of \\nscience is prodigious. Furtheriiiore the \\nscience-trained teacher lias become accus- \\ntomed to the characteristic specialized \\nwritings of science-writings more largely \\nfactual than theoretical which have a suc- \\ncinct and precise method of expression of \\ntheir own. To study tlie voluiiiinous and \\nseemingly vague and wordy nieanderings \\nof the educational philosophers and tlie \\nreports of policy committees Iias appeared \\nto be a fruitless if not an impossible task \\nto inany busy science teachers. Cut tlie \\nfault has been practical, if not moral. Until \\nlarge numbers of science teachers are able \\nto react in concert to policy as it is formu- \\nlated, until they participate in and initiate \\nthe formulation of policy which affects \\nthem, they will remain in tlie back seat of \\nthe vehicle of educational progress,. \\nHence the need for a department of \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION devoted to reporting \\nand interpreting significant trends in edu- \\ncational policy as proposed by the major \\nformulators of such policy. It will, of \\ncourse, be impossible to discuss all the re- \\nports prepared by national and regional \\neducational and non-educational organiza- \\ntions. But an attempt will be made to \\npresent a distillation of those which appear \\nmost significant, and to interpret such \\nstatements in terms of their implications \\nfor science teachers.

Digests of research investigations of \\nthe various aspects of the teaching of \\nscience, presented in a format similar to \\nthat used in the three volumes of Digests \\nof Investigations in the Teaching of \\nScieiict.. These digests will be chiefly \\nthose of unpublished studies, especially \\ndissertations. \\n2. Reports of iniportant research studies \\nunder way in various centers. \\n3. Authoritative summaries of progress \\nmade through research toward the solution \\nof certain important problems or toward \\nthe clarifying of certain basic ideas or coii- \\ncepts. For example, there have been iiiaiiy \\nefforts to clarify the concept of “scientific \\nprinciple” and to make available authori- \\ntative lists of such principles ; for the next \\nissue, Dr. W. Edgar hIartiii is preparing \\na historical suniiiiary of the important re- search that has been carried on in this area \\nsince Dr. Elliot R. Downing’s pioneer \\nwork. \\n4. Interpretations of the practical iin- \\nplications of selected investigations or of \\ngroups of investigations dealing with areas \\nof instruction, such as the uses and values \\nof different types of visual and auditory \\naids and the relative values of teaching \\nmethods. \\nThese plans are tentative. Suggestions \\nfor making this department useful to class- \\nroom teachers as well as to research work- \\ners will be welcomed. \\n-F.D.C. \\nPRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT \\nSeminar on Reading Disabilities, January \\nConference on Reading Instruction, June 29 to February 2, 1945 \\n26 to June 29, 1945 \\nThe Reading Clinic Staff of the School of \\nEducation, The Pennsylvania State College, State \\nCollege, Pennsylvania, is sponsoring two impor- \\ntant meetings on reading problems during 1945. \\nThe Annual Seminar on Reading Disabilities \\nwill be held from January 29 to February 2, \\n1945.

Once called General Sciewce Quarterly, its name was \\nchanged in 1929 to indicate its broadening scope. \\nNow SCIENCE EDUCATION is again reconsidering its editorial policies, \\nwith a view to serving teachers more effectively in the present dynamic period. \\nA meeting of the Board of Directors of Science Education, Incorporated, was \\ncalled for this purpose, and as a result of the discussions a coinniittee was \\nappointed and charged with the responsibility of malting the journal inore \\nserviceable to all science teachers and others concerned with science education. \\nTo this end, there will be reports of recent advances in scientific research \\nthat are affecting our ways of living; descriptions of procedures in the class- \\nrooms of good teachers ; suggestions for field trips, laboratory work, and the \\nuse of visual aids; and specimens of evaluation instruments. Articles on \\nresearch in science education will continue to be published and the book \\nreviews and abstracts of current periodical literature will, of course, be \\nretained . \\nThe Coniinittee solicits the suggestions of readers of SCIENCE EDUCATION \\nfor improving the journal. It is hoped that a sufficient number of ideas will \\nbe contributed to make possible the inclusion of a “Readers Department” in \\neach of the next few issues. \\nFLORENCE G. BILLIG \\nGERALD S.

This was espe- \\ncially true for “Science Education” under the editorship of Dr. Clarence Pruitt. \\nIt has established itself as an important medium for the exchange of experiences \\nand ideas in the teaching profession. \\nThe next few issues will still show Dr. Pruitt’s hand since they will contain \\nmany articles accepted by him. We will publish them in the approximate order in \\nwhich they were received. \\nI will try to continue the good and valid features of this tradition, but at the \\nsame time adapt the Journal to the ever-changing modern requirements of science \\nteaching and science education. Science teachers for all levels of instruction should \\neagerly wait for the next issue to receive information and inspiration from the \\npages of this Journal. It will also serve general education science teaching from \\nthe elementary grades through the junior college years. It should keep its readers \\ninformed about innovations and curricula in methods, in materials and in evaluative \\nprocedures. It will not be confined to reporting on sophisticated research in science \\neducation, but also with “grass roots” investigations. These pilot explorations \\nshould prompt others to experiment in their classrooms. \\nThe Journal should become a forum where science educators can discuss the \\nsociological, psychological and philosophical background for science teaching. It \\nshould reflect their reaction to current innovations and should inform them about \\nteacher education programs at home and abroad. Special issues designed in \\nadvance might deal with significant special topics. \\nIncluded will be critical reviews of books of consequence in the teaching of \\nscience and in the preparation of teachers. Because new texts and multi-media \\naids are now covered by other publications, these will not be included. \\nTo make “Science Education” reach a maximum of usefulness to the profes- \\nsion, the editor solicits suggestions and aid from interested readers. Letters and \\nguest editorials will be welcomed. \\nN. E. BINGHAM, EDITOR \\nSCIENCE EDUCATION Editorial Comment on Me Now and Me And My Environment: Science for \\nEMH Students \\nThe article, by W. D. Grant describes the units of the Me Now and Me And My \\nEnvironment programs for educable mentally handicapped students, developed by the \\nBSCS Project and the role of the teacher during implementation of the program. There \\nare four units from Me Now and one of the planned six units from Me And My \\nEnvironment avadable commercially. \\nSince all children are confronted with science concepts and problems in their daily \\nlives, it is appropriate to provide slow learning children with the tools they will need to \\noperate within and perhaps contribute to our complex society. Teachers preparing to \\nteach EMH children and teachers who expect to teach \"normal\" students but who find \\nthemselves expected to instruct a heterogeneous ability level mixture of students must be \\nmade aware of the research findings regarding learning by EMH students. \\nLanguage development is delayed in retarded children but they follow approximately \\nthe same sequence of development as do normal children, with IQ not predicting the \\nstage of language development as well as chronological age (Suppes, 1974). The cognitive \\nfunctions of language are not well developed in retarded children which dictates the \\nreduction or elimination of language-dependent learning activities for the EMH student. \\nReading comprehension and concept formation are statistically correlated for \\nretarded children, much more than IQ measures. Surprisingly, EMH students have been \\nfound to do better on process tasks using classification and quantification than on rote \\nlearning activities. \\nMany studies have indicated that retarded persons show the greatest difficulty with \\nlanguage control and verbal labeling. EMH children perform poorly on the discovery and \\napplication of language-relevant concepts, but perform equal to nonretarded children in \\nsolving problems that depend on perceptual rather than verbal modes of solution (Suppes, \\n1974). \\nScience teachers worlung with retarded children must be aware that activities which \\nrequire abstract thinking and mental (rather than real) manipulation of ideas are \\ncompletely inappropriate in a curriculum for the mentally handicapped. Concepts and \\nskills must be gained through experience and practice in using them; not internalized \\nfrom vicarious experiences. EMH students are not able, after observing, hearing, or being \\ntold something, to analyze the information, make it fit their own conceptual \\norganization, and act on it. \\nScience as a program must consist of a carefully developed sequence of skills and \\nconcepts so that the children can assimilate their environment and accommodate new \\nthought patterns into existing ones. \\n247 Editorial Comment on Science for Handicapped Students: Deaf Education \\nThis article describes the very specialized pedogogical techniques which are required \\nfor teaching science to deaf students. Since there are no national, commercially available \\ncurricula available, science teachers must modify existing materials to accommodate the \\nlanguage impairment that deafness involves. When the language dependent.components of \\nproblem solving and process oriented tasks are removed, deaf children can perform as well \\nas their hearing peers. \\nDiscovery oriented learning may be inappropriate for deaf learners, because of its \\nlanguage dependent base. The challenge to create an intellectually challenging and highly \\nmotivating curriculum which works around the language problem has yet to be answered. \\nEducation of teachers of the hearing impaired is controlled by the Council on \\nEducation of the Deaf. Science Teachers with no background in deaf education should be \\naware of several unique characteristics of deaf learners. \\nThe unusual feature of deaf speech to hearing people is a source of difficulty. As \\nexpected, the greater the hearing loss, the lower the ability to communicate orally. \\nCompetence in abstraction is closely linked to verbal ability, buta deaf children can \\ngeneralize when the language requirements of the experiment are within the capacity of \\nthe deaf child. \\nScience educators must not assume that use of manual communication will \\nsubsequently transfer to written language. Requiring written responses may handicap deaf \\nlearners and not validly assess their real understanding. \\n255 SCIENCE TEACHER \\nEDUCATION \\nJudy C. Egelston, Guest Editor \\nEditorial Comment on Adapting Science Materials for the Blind (ASMB): \\nStudent Outcomes \\nThe following paper represents an effort to investigate whether additional concrete \\nexperiences with objects will foster the logical development of blind children. Linn and \\nThier have described the development and use of the ASMB (Adapting Science Materials \\n‘for the Blind) program, a modification of SCIS. They report gains in manipulative and \\nconcrete skills and greater student independence in proceeding through science activities. \\nAverage and above-average blind students but not those of low ability made gains in the \\nprocess area also. An individualized science program is also being developed and \\nevaluated. \\nSince there is no reason to believe that the logical thinking skills of the blind child \\ndevelop differently from those of their sighted peers, a currently fashionable trend is \\nplacement of the visually impaired child in regular public school classes. The implications \\nfor teacher preservice and inservice education are important. \\nScience teachers whose classes contain visually impaired students integrated with \\ntheir sighted peers should be aware of several aspects of the research reported on \\neducation for the blind. Blind children develop language to meet social approval and tend \\nto use terms referring to visual experience more than to experiences obtained through \\nother sensory modes. This “verbalism,” while not a significant problem in personal \\nadjustment, does decrease with an increase in intelligence, chronological age, and \\nexperience (Harley, 1963). \\nThe myth of sensory compensation which alleges that handicapped people \\ncompensate for their deficiency by developing superior discrimination in their other \\nsenses has been thoroughly unsupported for blind children (Hare, Hammill, and Crandell, \\n1970). \\nRapid or compressed speech can produce satisfactory comprehension and is much \\nmore efficient than typical tape recordings or readings in braille. For scientific materials \\nthere was no significant loss of comprehension through speeds of 275 words per minute \\n(Suppes, 1974). \\nMany researchers have shown that deficiencies in concept formation and use of \\nabstract concepts occur in blind children and adults. \\nThe use of anything but concrete, experimental curricula would seemingly be \\ninappropriate at all levels of the blind child’s education. \\nAs expected, visually impaired children need more time to explore their materials to \\ntheir satisfaction and engage in more spontaneous talk than do their sighted peers. \\nIf science teachers with visually handicapped children mainstreamed in their classes \\nare knowledgeable about these findings and about the existence of programs like ASMB, \\ntheir students may have an opportunity to develop their full potential for success in their \\nstudy of science. \\n235 236 J.

Taken together with other recent reports showing that 10 to 35% of \\nseven and eight year old children can use formal operations in selected subject matter \\nareas (see previous reports in the Learning Section), we see that the weight of evidence \\nargues against the value of Piaget’s age norms for cognitive developmental stages. \\nAlthough most studies support the sequence of developmental stages described by Piaget, \\nthis editor sees these largely as an artifact, a gradual cognitive differentiation, now best \\nexplained by Ausubel’s (1968) theory of cognitive learning. Implications for science \\ninstruction are substantially different using Ausubel’s theory for interpretation of the \\nkind of data reported here than results from the use of Piaget’s model. Both Piaget and \\nAusubel stress the need for “concrete” experience during early stages of new learning, but \\nAusubel’s theory clarifies this need in terms of development of specific concepts which \\nsubsequently can function in meaningful reception learning. Ausubel’s theory stresses the \\nneed for more systematic and deliberate instructional emphasis on developing an \\nunderstanding of concepts needed for “formal” thinking in sciences or other disciplines. \\nJoseph D.

Novak, Section Editor \\nEditorial Comment on \\n\"An Analysis of An Alternative Instructional Model for Disadvantaged \\nStudents and An Analysis of Learner Efficiency When Individualized and \\nGroup -Instructional Formats are Utilized with Disadvantaged Students\" \\nMany educators recognize the vicious circle of failure induced by failure that charac- \\nterizes school experience for many disadvantaged students. In the two papers reported \\nhere, an approach to teachmg science that circumvents learning difficulties derived in part \\nfrom absenteeism and prior learning deficiencies is described, and evidence for effective- \\nness of student-paced instruction is offered. \\n235 ISSUES & TRENDS \\nLeopold E. Klopfer, Section Editor \\nFrom the Section Editor’s Desk \\nSCIENTIFIC LITERACY REEXAMINED* \\nIn our second Issues and Trends section, Michael Agin reopened the discussion in this \\njournal of the meaning of scientific literacy with his position paper, “Education for \\nScientific Literacy: A Conceptual Frame of Reference and Some Applications,” Science \\nEducation, 58: 403415 (1974). Subsequent to the publication of his paper, Agin under- \\ntook the organization of a symposium for the exchange of ideas about scientific literacy \\nthat was held at the annual meeting of the National Association of Research in Science \\nTeaching (NARST) in Los Angeles on March 18, 1975. The two contributions in the \\npresent Issues and Trends section are based on presentations made at the NARST sym- \\nposium. \\nIn the striking manner that science educators have come to expect from one of the \\nsenior members of this profession, Milton 0. Pella contributes an expansive polemical \\npiece on “The Place or Function of Science for a Literate Citizenry.” The perspective on \\nscientific literacy that is presented here warrants consideration in the discussion of this \\ncontemporary issue, for Pella and his colleagues at the Scientific Literacy Center, Uni- \\nversity of Wisconsin, Madison, have ploughed in that complex domain both long and \\nbroadly. The harvest from their energetic efforts has included numerous studies and pub- \\nlications concerned with scientific literacy, so that our author does not speak here as a \\nneophyte by any means. Accordingly, the alert reader might anticipate that there is as \\nmuch meaning behind the words in this piece as there is in the words themselves. \\nThe second contribution to this section is a position paper on “Science Literacy \\nand Alternative Futures,” by George T. O’Hearn. Offered here is not only another specu- \\nlative broadening of the concept of scientific literacy, but also an exploration of some \\npotential curricullar implementations of the proposed perspective of providing instruction \\ntoward scientific literacy in relation to the future. In a sense, O’Hearn proposes a double \\nchallenge to teachers of science, who all too often do not teach science for the purpose \\nof developing students’ scientific literacy, and who are accustomed to teaching about the \\npast instead of the future. That powerful means should be found for meeting that double \\nchallenge seems crucial. \\nEven with these new contributions to the reexamination of scientific literacy, we feel \\nconfident that the last word about this issue has not yet been written. We invite the \\nreader to express his or her views by submitting a position paper, a polemical piece, or a \\ncreative commentary (for specifications of these terms, see vol. 59, p. 407) to be con- \\nsidered for publication in the Issues and Trends section. L.E.K. \\n*These editorial comments introduce the Fist two articles in this issue’s Issues & Trends section. \\n95 Editorial Comment on \\n\"Concept Formation as a Function of Instructional Procedure or: What \\nResults from Ineffective Teaching\" \\nThis carefully done study by Dr. Herron and his colleagues illustrates the futility of \\nmost efforts at research to compare instructional methods. When one recognizes how \\nincrediby more complex alternative instructional methods in science would be than the \\ncomparisons studied by Herron, it is obvious that such research serves little more than \\npolitical purposes. Although occasionally schools and curriculum projects find it \\nnecessary to make claims for the value of their instructional approaches, this type of \\nresearch does little to advance our understanding of the learning process and methods by \\nwhich instruction can be improved. \\nWe trust that our colleagues in Science Education will take counsel from the paper \\noffered here and expand their research energies on problems that are more soundly based \\nin learning theory, rather than studies which deal with alternative instructional strategies. \\nJoseph D. Novak \\n373 Editorial Comment on \\n\"Review of Research on Mathemagenic Behavior: Implications for Teaching \\nand Learning Science\" \\nThis paper shows how Rothkopfs ideas on mathemagenic behavior are supported by \\nresearch and have relevance to science teaching. The editor sees much useful guidance in \\nRothkopfs model, although his theory fails to show the crucial role concepts play in \\nfacilitation of learning and the primacy of concept learning to all mathemagenic behavior. \\nAusubel\\'s cognitive learning theory provides a more descriptive model for design of re- \\nsearch and science instruction. \\nJoseph D. Novak \\n389 LEARNING \\nJoseph D. Novak, Section Editor \\nEditorial Comment on \\n“The Effect of a Series of Advanced Organizers in Increasing Meaningful \\nLearning “ \\nFrequently, studies of the effect of advance organizers on facilitation of learning fail \\nto consider the importance of tying new information to previously learned concepts, and \\nhence the advance organizers fail to function. Another problem with “advance organizer” \\nstudies is that criterion tests may employ items measuring simple cognitive abilities and \\nhence fail to discriminate for improved problem solving or higher-order thinking that \\nshould accrue from meaningful learning. The authors of this work have taken both of \\nthese problems into account and have shown a significant influence of advance organizers \\non learning. \\n363 COMMENTS AND CRITICISM \\nEditorial Comment on \"A Child\\'s \\nForming the Concept of Speed\\'\\' \\nJOSEPH D. NOVAK \\nDivision of Science Education, \\nNew York State College of Agriculture, \\nCornell University, \\nIthaca, New York 14850 \\nThis paper, as other papers recently published in this section, shows some of the \\ninadequacies of Piaget\\'s model for cognitive development. This editor finds that the \\nresults of Mori, Kojima, and Den0 are better explained by Ausubel\\'s cognitive learning \\ntheory wherein new learning is primarily a function of the adequacy of prior, relevant \\nconcepts, the quality of new learning experiences, and, to a lesser extent, the general level \\nof the learner\\'s cognitive differentiation. \\nWe suggest that future studies of the type reported here analyze cognitive gains taking \\ninto account differential levels of achievement prior to instruction. We would predict that \\nmost of the group gains in achievement resulting from instruction would take place as a \\nresult of comparatively large individual gains by those students who scored best on the \\npretests, thus supporting Ausubel\\'s theory. \\n579 \\nScience Education, 60(4): 579 (1976) \\n0 1976 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Editorial Comment on \"The Effect of \\nLanguage on a Child\\'s Conception of \\nSpeed: A Comparative Study on Japanese \\nand Thai Children\" \\nJOSEPH D. NOVAK \\nDivision of Science Education, \\nNew York State College of Agriculture, \\nCorn ell University , \\nIthaca, New York 14850 \\nRegular readers of Science Education will know that this Section Editor has \\nencouraged exploration of learning models as a basis for research. Much good work has \\nbeen done with the guidance of Piaget\\'s developmental psychology, but this editor has \\nbeen urging the exploration of alternative theoretical models, especially that presented by \\nDavid Ausubel in his Psychologv of Education: A Cognitive View. \\nToo many American educators are unfamiliar with any views on cognitive develop- \\nment other than Piaget\\'s work. The very important work of Vygotsky, summarized in \\nThought and Language, and Whorf\\'s work presented in Language, Thought and Reality: \\nSelected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf; are almost unknown in this country and \\nseldom referred to. Although Vygotsky and Whorf were born about the same time as \\nPiaget (1896) both of their careers ended by early death (1934 and 1941, respectively) \\nand thus they could not continue to promulgate their views. Vygotsky and Whorf \\ndiffered from Piaget in their strong emphasis on the role of language as an influence in \\nconcept learning. \\nIn the neat piece of research presented here, Mori, Kojima, and Tadang show \\nevidence for a very strong influence of language on children\\'s acquisition of concepts of \\nspeed. Thai children did significantly better than Japanese children on two experiments \\nto predict speed, despite the fact that the Thai chldren averaged seven months younger in \\nage. If we assume that the Thai and Japanese chldren represent unbiased samples from \\ntheir populations, we must concur with the authors that impoItant differences in lan- \\nguage available to mediate concept learning could very well account for the significant \\ndifferences in the samples. These results contradict the more age-referenced develop- \\nmental views of Piaget and support Vygotsky\\'s and Whorf\\'s emphasis on language as a \\nsubstantial influence on concept learning. The results are also consistent with Ausubel\\'s \\nviews that concept labels once acquired meaningfully can be manipulated by children in \\nnovel problem-solving situations and hence language plays an important role in cognitive \\ndevelopment . \\n58 1 \\nScience Education 60(4): 581 (1976) \\n0 1976 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Guest Editorial: Sixty Years of Science \\nEducation \\nMILTON 0. PELLA \\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706 \\nScience Education, in its 60th year, was originally established as the General Science \\nQuarterly in November 1916, with W. G. Whitman as the editor and publisher. It had \\nan advisory board of more than 30 individuals which included such names as Otis \\nCaldwell, Harry Carpenter, W. L. Eikenberry, Earl Glenn, and Charles Pieper. \\nThe first article in the first issue was entitled “Method in Teaching” by John Dewey. \\n“Method means a way to a result, a means to an end, a path to a goal. Method therefore \\nvaries with the end to be reached. Without a clear notion of the end we cannot proceed \\nintelligently upon the journey toward it. The end of science teaching is to make us aware \\nof what constitutes the most effective use of mind, of intelligence.” \\nThe main objective of General Science Quarterly, stated in the first issue, was to \\npromote the understanding and teaching of general science. The contents presented were \\nconcerned with philosophical foundations, methods of instruction, curricular implications \\nresulting from the introduction of general science in grade 9, the controversy on prophetic \\nstatements about general science in the elementary, junior, and senior high schools, \\ncommittee reports relevant to general science, and articles that related to pure science \\n(probably intended to enrich or update the academic background of the teacher). It could \\nnot be stated that research was reported; however, it could not be stated that research \\nwas lacking; the concern was to create a noble experiment: teaching general science. \\nThere was only one issue in 1916 and a portion of it would interest the science educator \\nof 1976. If one does not know the history of a subject, then he is not fully knowledgeable \\nin it. \\nWe now may call this body of knowledge integrated science but have the purposes \\nchanged, has the philosophic foundation changed? It is true the name general science \\nhas temporarily been revised and some of its content changed, but nothing mandates \\nagainst a return to either previous state. \\nFor those of you who think that “there is something new under the sun” in process \\nteaching or discovery learning, look at the second issue of Volume 1, page 80. “In these \\nlessons no information came from the teacher. The boys and girls reasoned from their \\nown experience and observation. No textbooks were used though the children were at \\nliberty to consult books and persons if they wished.” \\nEach issue of the Quarterly included a section called the “General Science Bulletin.” \\nThe contents of the section related to psychological factors affecting method, materials \\nand organization, social factors, unit selection, and lesson and unit organization. \\nTo refresh the readers’ memories so their knowledge may be utilized in a discursive \\nmanner, please recall that 19 16 was a time of struggle within a world at war. It was a \\n433 \\nScience Education 60(4): 433-439(1976) \\n0 I976 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 434 PELLA \\ntime of rapid population growth. It was a time when mechanization was replacing people \\nin jobs. There was more attention being directed toward schools and their products and \\nfunctions. More pupils were entering high school. The high school was essentially in its \\nearly adolescence even though it had been born more than 100 years before. The number \\nof secondary schools in the United States rose from one in 1821 to 13,07 1 in 19 14, and \\nthis increase stimulated some concern. This concern was reflected in the Quarterly: by \\n19 16 there were more than 1,500,000 pupils in grades 9-1 2. The school curriculum was \\nbeing examined in terms of the needs of individuals in a rapidly changing society. \\nThe article by Herbert Brownell on page 140, Volume I, No. 3 will provide up-to-date \\npedagogy. It would fit well in a 1976 course in the pedagogy of science instruction. \\nThe first evidence of a legitimate research report appears in issue No. 4, where the \\nresults of a survey related to the status of general science in Pennsylvania were given. \\nIs it surprising that by 1915 (date of the study) more than one-half of the schools in \\nPennsylvania offered general science, 1 16 of 222 that reported? Only 114 offered physics \\nand 103 offered chemistry. Even fewer schools offered biology, while some retained botany \\nand/or zoology. In addition to this it was reported that principals liked general science \\nand it was being taught by teachers trained in college to teach general science in 88% \\nof the cases. \\nIssue No. 4 of Volume 1, carried another new feature-book reviews. This service \\nfunction has been continued through volume 60. \\nThose who think the humanistic or the need to include humanism in the science pro- \\ngram is new will be surprised. The article by Woodhill in the November, 191 7 issue ad- \\ndresses itself to this topic. “Science teaching, if it follows the examples of Pasteur, Far- \\naday, etc., may not be justly differentiated from other subjects as materialistic or lacking \\nin cultural or humanitarian elements.” Although this presentation is a plea for project \\nteaching, the evidence indicates that culture and humanistics were a concern. In the same \\nissue an article by Whitman was published, “In these days of struggle for world democracy \\nthere is a loud call for science and for men of scientific training, but the value of science \\napplied to the development of nations in peace is by no means less than it is for nations \\nat war.” You may wish to compare this comment with many made during the following \\nWorld War 11 in Science Education. \\nIn a report to the readers on the financial problems of the journal at the close of the \\nfirst year of operation (the expenses exceeded the estimates by 30%), the editor states, \\n“Democracy in a professional science journal is as essential as in a government.” \\nIt is difficult to refrain from citing the many fine statements related to science teaching \\nmade in the journal nearly 60 years ago that are as relevant today as they were then. \\nThe issues of General Science Quarterly consistently represented more service, in- \\nformation, and explanations of methods than research. We must remember that its \\npurpose was to promote the teaching of general science in the schools. The contents of \\nthe journal reflect the changes in our society from little emphasis on science education, \\nto science in war, to science for peace. The Quarterly dealt with current topics under the \\neditorship of Whitman. \\nAs one leafs through past issues, he finds they are a mirror of time; many of our \\nproblems are 60 years old. It is a great tribute to the Advisory Board that the Quarterly \\nwas up-to-date. Note that in 1920 attention is given to sex education and social hygiene, \\nscience clubs, teaching democracy through general science, science for peace, the labo- \\n 1098237x, 1976, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730600403 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The apparent need for civic or practical \\nscience was recognized. The textbooks in general science and the journals reflect such \\nattitudes. \\nIn 1925 with the beginning of volume 10 the editorship was temporarily passed to 0. \\nE. Underhill because Whitman was out of the country. Some changes also occurred in \\nthe journal; there was increased attention given to research, general science achievement, \\nstatus of teacher training in Missouri, and new types of tests in science. This was a turning \\npoint in editorial policy since research was included from that time on. \\nWhitman returned to the editorship after a year abroad and continued to add more \\nresearch studies. \\nIt was in November, 1928 that General Science Quarterly became the official organ \\nof the National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) with an editorial \\nboard consisting of Charles J. Pieper, chairman; Earl Glenn; and W. G. Whitman and \\na staff of associate editors assigned according to their specializations such as nature study \\nand elementary science, junior high school science, high school biology, high school \\nchemistry, high school physics, supervision, teacher training, and research in science \\neducation. \\nThe day of the single-purpose journal had been surpassed in meeting modern realistic \\nneeds. General science was now well established and it was time to concentrate on larger \\nand more pressing issues. This change may have been the result of the action of NARST \\nin its negotiation for the journal as an official organ. If this is the case, then the results \\nin terms of the changes that occurred in the journal were not really dramatic. This may \\nhave been due to the fact that the journal had been changing prior to this time in order \\nto fulfill more cosmopolitan interests in science education. \\nIn May, 1929 the name of the journal changed to Science Education, 13 years after \\nits founding and dedication, to promote the teaching of general science. The fact that \\nthe Quarterly became Science Education and the official organ of NARST did not \\ntransfer its ownership, this was retained by Whitman. It was aptly stated by W. L. Eik- \\nenberry, “. . . express thanks of the Association to Professor Whitman for his enthusiasm \\nin putting the General Science Quarterly, now Science Education, at the service of the \\nAssociation.” \\nThe stated policy of Science Education was to devote its pages to the improvement \\nof the teaching of science at all levels from kindergarden through senior college. The \\nrepresented fields were to be nature education and elementary science,.junior high school \\nscience and general science, senior high school biology, senior high school chemistry, \\nsenior high school physics, training of teachers, supervision of science instruction, and \\nresearch in science education. \\nThis policy was reflected in volume 14, which was more varied than before. It included \\nresearch reports on objectives, curricular content, course prerequisites, superstitions, \\nmeasurement, pupil success, teaching methods, as well as service articles of an expository \\nnature. \\n 1098237x, 1976, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730600403 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Services were offered: those related to teaching methods, types and \\nuses of demonstrations, apparatus construction, science clubs, project method, use of \\nthe laboratory, etc. These were probably considered to appeal to the classroom teacher. \\nThe research reported during the 1930’s related to teacher training, knowledge assess- \\nment, attitude measurement, learning problems, and curriculum practices. \\nThe business phase of Science Education seems to have also slightly changed. The \\nmasthead page stated “Published by Science Education Inc.” rather than “Published \\nby Whitman.” It does not seem, however, that the ownership was transferred. \\nAt this time there were changes in the editorial staff. Charles Pieper became editor, \\nW. G. Whitman became associate editor, Lois Shoemaker represented the National \\nCouncil of Supervisors of Elementary Science, and W. L. Eikenberry represented the \\nScience Association of the Middle States. This staff remained for many years. Again \\nit may help to recall that the world entered an economic depression in 1929. \\nIt was in February, 1933 that Science Education became the official organ of the \\nNational Council of Supervisors of Elementary Science which later became the National \\nCouncil on Elementary Science (NCES). Also during this year, with W. L. Eikenberry \\ninitiating the action, the Science Association of the Middle States was formed. \\nIt was in 1934 that some consideration of the psychology of science teaching again \\nappeared in the journal. The problem related to the ability to recall and to infer. This \\narticle reveals that science teachers and science educators believed science laws to be \\nthe products of inductive inference. Is this error still a part of our science education? It \\nwas also during this year that Science Education published its first article on individu- \\nalized instruction. \\nThe operation and service of Science Education continued under the same guidance \\nuntil 1937. Part of an editorial by Charles Pieper is cited here to show the reputation and \\nforesight of the journal committee. \\nThe enlarged scope and plans for the new journal were described in the November, \\n1929, issue. The purposes there stated have been modified only slightly since that time. \\nScience Education has continued to be an open forum on problems and practices of \\nteaching science as a part of general education at the various school levels. In addition \\nto this mission it has directed attention to the education of science teachers. It hasbeen \\nthe policy of the editorial board to print among the articles and editorials discriminat- \\ning and challenging points of view. We have attempted to provide analytical and con- \\nstructive discussions and reports on the philosophy of science education, content and \\nobjectives of science teaching, psychology of learning in science, instructional materi- \\nals, and measurement of learning products. Now and then we included research studies \\nbut there has never been the policy of limiting the journal to reports of investigations \\ndespite the reports which have come to us from some who have not followed closely the \\npurposes and content of the publication. \\nNaturally we are pleased with the many words of commendation which have come to \\nour desk. The appeal of the journal, the constructive activities of our efficient Business \\nManager, and the support of our subscribers and advertisers have made it possible for \\nus to carry forward our purposes. We are now pleased to announce an expansion of the \\njournal from a quarterly to seven issues each year. The present volume (volume 21) \\nwill have three additional issues to be published in October, November, and December. \\n 1098237x, 1976, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730600403 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The new subscription price, begin- \\nning with the present issue, is two dollars and fifty cents. \\nWe take this occasion to express our thanks to all who have given us help during the \\nyears past and to invite our readers to submit to us for publication articles, classroom \\nnotes, editorials and news notes, to the end that we may better realize our objective to \\nmake Science Education an open forum of challenging and helpful discussions relating \\nto the theory, content, materials and practices of instruction in science. Through the \\ncontributions which we receive and publish we may hope to improve the place of \\nscience in general education. \\nIn 1939 there was another change in the editorial committee; Pieper became editor, \\nPruitt became business manager and assistant editor, and Francis Curtis became assistant \\neditor. The representatives of the professional organizations served by the journal were \\nEikenberry (Science Association of Middle States), Ellsworth W. Obourn (National \\nAssociation for Research in Science Teaching), and Lois Shoemaker (National Council \\nfor Elementary Science). These officials were supported or supplemented by a large \\nnumber of associate and departmental editors. \\nThe 1938 volume reflects greater attention to research than any previous one. Curtis \\nprepared a Digest of Unpublished Investigations in the January issue and later in the \\nyear prepared a bibliography of the 50 best published investigations. It seems that the \\njournal was being used as a vehicle for developing standards for research in science \\nteaching. The research articles replaced only a small segment of the other material \\npublished since the service, philosophic and prophetic, and explanations of methods ar- \\nticles were also present. \\nThe practices remained relatively unchanged during the next couple of years, however; \\nthere was a noticeable change in the educational positions of the authors of the articles; \\nthere was a decrease in the number of elementary and secondary school teachers and an \\nincrease in the number of articles from colleges and universities, as well as local, state, \\nand national supervisors and pure scientists. \\nIn 1940 there was a special issue on elementary science: Bertha Parker, Florence Billig, \\nGlenn Blough, and Helen Dolman Blough serving as editors. The names of the authors \\nof the articles read like an introduction to “Who’s Who” in elementary science and \\neducation in 1940. \\nThe publication of a special issue on elementary science was repeated in 1941 with \\nPersing, Cunningham, Russell, and Hudspeth serving as editors. It is also noted that the \\nDigest of Unpublished Investigations disappeared about as quickly as it appeared. \\nThe changes that occurred in 1942 probably reflected the uncertainty of the time, \\nanother war-World War 11. The February-October issues wire under the editorship \\nof Charles Pieper and the October-December issue was the product of a publications \\ncommittee with Whitman as the chairman and Billig, Craig, Obourn, Powers, and Pruitt \\ncomprising the committee. The time was erratic and so was the appearance of the issues \\nduring this year. \\nIn 1944 there was another change in editorial guidance-S. R. Powers became the \\neditor, Elsa M. Meder became the associate editor, with Mervin Oaks as advertising \\nmanager, Clarence M. Pruitt as circulation manager, and a publications committee \\ncomposed of Florence Billig, Gerald Craig, Ellsworth Obourn, S. R. Powers, and W. G. \\n 1098237x, 1976, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730600403 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

These changes were necessary because Science Education was \\napparently not keeping pace with contemporary needs. The recognition of this problem \\nis a reflection of the keen observations of those directing the policies of the journal. They \\nalso believed, as Whitman had, that the democratic spirit must prevail. A questionnaire \\nrelated to the suspected areas of difficulty was prepared and circulated. They wanted \\nto know what the consuming public wanted. They received responses and yielded to the \\nsuggestions. The result was an increased emphasis on research, however, the other service \\ntypes of articles were still included. If you examine this period you will note that the re- \\nsearch became more varied; there were experimental, survey, comparative, etc., types \\nof articles reported. It will also reveal that there was an increased influence of educational \\npsychology on science education and some indication that the structure of science was \\nstill cast in the structure of inductive logic. \\nIn 1945 another change occurred in the editorial policy as reflected in the journal. S. \\nR. Powers remained as the editor and department editors were added: R. Will Burnett \\nbecame the department editor for Educational Trends, Francis Curtis became the editor \\nfor Research, and John Richardson became the editor for Teaching Reports. The de- \\npartment editors provided papers for several issues but this valuable addition soon dis- \\nappeared. \\nThe next change came in the postwar year of 1946 when Clarence Pruitt became editor \\nand owner of Science Education. The contents of the journal during the postwar era re- \\nflected the rebellion of the time against a subject matter-oriented curriculum. The em- \\nphasis seemed to be on the social implications of science with the focal point being atomic \\nenergy. References to general education, child’s needs, society, science processes, cor- \\nrelated or integrated curricula, and common learnings curricula were common. \\nAlso during this era the real service of providing a background and an explanation of \\nthe 46th yearbook of NSSE was given. It is regrettable that the presentation did not result \\nin more of a forum-type discussion. \\nThe journal continued to provide a valuable variety of services to schools and scholars; \\nthe kinds of articles continued without appreciable change with the exception that more \\nattention was given to research than exposition papers. The articles were current and \\nwell selected despite the fact that no panel of judges was used in their selection and re- \\njection. \\nOne of the many inovations of the journal was the publication of “Science Education \\nRecognition Awards” in April 1956. This preserved the personal histories of some scholars \\nin science education who were truly pioneers. Surely all those recognized were not of equal \\nstature; however, all did make contributions. It is unfortnate that as human beings we \\nare unable to consistently judge the value of scholarly products. How often we are con- \\nfused or confounded by those who have a greater gift of words than ideas or knowledge. \\nDr. Pruitt had a good idea and put it to work. Do you recall the contributions of Gerald \\nCraig, Francis Curtis, Charles Pieper, Harry Cunningham, Guy Cahoon, Ira Davis, \\nEllsworth (Bud) Obourn, E. Lawrence Palmer, Harold Wise, and Morris Meister? As \\na personal note from one who knew all but three of these listed-they were real scholars, \\nreal contributors, and real pioneers in science education. This can be said of nearly all \\nof those selected for recognition. \\nThe policies of the editor continued until the journal was sold to John Wiley & Sons \\nin 1969 and Dr. N. E. Bingham was chosen as editor.

In his statement as editor he pledged that Science \\nEducation would serve general education science teaching from the elementary through \\njunior college years. It would keep its readers informed about innovations and curricula, \\nin methods, in materials, and in evaluation procedures. It would report grassroots in- \\nvestigations as well as sophisticated research. \\nThe journal is thus looked upon as a stimulator as well as a reporter of progress in \\nscience education and as a forum for discussion. \\nThe editor, in cooperation with the very capable members of the Editorial Committee, \\nhas truly carried on the tradition of his predecessors in making the journal a service to \\nscholarship. It is considered today to be a publication with a jury and properly so, because \\nwith such judgment comes respect. \\nFor 60 years Science Education has been the repository and the disseminator of per- \\nsistent, important, and at times, trivial and transcent thoughts, ideas, and creative \\nscholarship of leaders and followers in science teaching. Today its physical form differs \\nfrom the past; however, note that it contains sections on Teacher Education, Issues and \\nTrends, Learning, and International Education. Also note that it has produced special \\neditions, the latest of which was on International Education. Although it is no longer the \\norgan for NARST and NCES, it is the official organ of the Association for Education \\nof Teachers of Science. \\nA personal note, perhaps nostalgic in origin, is placed here. As the many articles and \\npapers have been reviewed in the preparation of this report one thing has once again \\nbecome evident. If only we had had the foresight to define some of the terms used in \\nscience education how valuable the research could have been. We still confuse facts with \\nlaws, concepts with laws, empirical laws with theoretical laws, scientific method with \\nregulative principles. We look upon the body of knowledge in science as being homoge- \\nneous rather than heterogeneous; we evidence the idea that there is a method of science \\nand there are processes of science that may be achieved by following algorithms (hy- \\npotheses, theories, experiment, observation, inference, etc.); we have never bothered to \\ndefine, understand, or know. \\nIt seems that those who have piloted the journal have seriously and consistently been \\nguided by beliefs similar to the following. Education is a deliberate effort to design and \\nexecute means toward desired ends or outcomes in the lives of human beings as individuals \\nand members of a society. Adults design and support schools because they want their \\nchildren educated better than they would be if left alone to develop in their natural and \\nsocial environments. Education is an affair of human means, methods, purpose, and ends. \\nThe ends and means of all education are interrelated and have consequences in the lives \\nof children. It is in the course of children’s development that the consequences of education \\ncontribute to civilization. Ignorance, vagueness, and mere good intention are of no more \\nvirtue in science education than in any other human enterprise. \\nIt to be hoped that the future task of science education will be to give a logical analysis \\nof its potentials and procedures related to the achievement of these potentials. It is logical \\nthat science education relates to laws, concepts, regulative principles, and other empirical \\nand theoretical science. This is not to say that the science teacher is a scientist since he \\nis not; he is the interpreter of the knowledge of science for future generations. \\n 1098237x, 1976, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730600403 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

NOVAK \\nThis fine research report on a continuing series of studies by Rowell and Dawson gives \\nfurther evidence that cognitive development can be influenced by appropriate instruction, \\nalbeit with some restrictions on the range of generalizability. Their findings are consistent \\nwith a continuing sequence of reports in the Learning section of this journal that show \\nthe important role of experience in cognitive development. \\nThis editor has suggested in previous comments and reports[ 1-31 that the best way \\nto “close the gap” between cognitive psychology and classroom practice is to adopt an \\nalternative to Piaget’s development psychology, i.e., the cognitive learning theory of David \\nAusubel[4]. Although the more recent writings of Inhelder move in the same direction, \\nwe see epistemological problems [2, Chap. 21 with variations on Piaget’s basic notions. \\nAusubel’s assimilation theory for cognitive development appears to us to rest on better \\nepistemological foundation, to better explain empirical results such as those reported \\nby Rowell and Dawson, and to have more power for the better design of classroom in- \\nstruction [l, 21. \\nAusubel’s theory places central emphasis on the role of existing concepts in the facil- \\nitation of meaningful learning. For this reason, and partly because broad, inclusive \\nconcepts have relevance to many phenomena and develop continuously over the educative \\nperiod, age does have some relevance for the adequacy and range of development of \\nconcepts such as “flotation.” However, we agree with Rowell and Dawson that the usual \\nPiagetian interpretations of the limitations of general concept development leads to much \\ntoo conservative views on the potential for instructional intervention. \\nSome recent research[ 51 suggests that meaningful (concept assimilated) learning can \\noccur with misconceptions as well as with scientifically accepted concepts. Rowell and \\n* Rowell, J. A. and C. J. Dawson, Science Education, 61(4): 527-540 ( 1977) \\n573 \\nScience Education 61(4): 573-574 (1977) \\nCJ I977 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 574 NOVAK \\nDawson show an illustration of this in the confusion some students manifest with ideas \\nof “heavier density.” We see this as an illustration of inappropriate integratiue recon- \\nciliation, resulting in students generating propositions that combine concepts of \\n“lighter-heavier’’ with concepts of “more-less dense” in inappropriate ways. This, in \\nour view, is not a developmental problem but rather a problem that can be addressed by \\nproperly designed instruction based on Ausubel’s assimilation theory (see Novak, ref. \\n2, Chaps. 5 and 6). Once again we encouraged our research colleagues to carefully ex- \\namine the power of an alternative model[3] for cognitive learning. \\nReferences \\n1. Novak, J.

NOVAK \\nCornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850 \\nWe continue to receive a majority of papers for the Learning section that report on \\nresearch dealing with cognitive developmental issues. Almost all of these studies were \\ndesigned with the assumption that Piaget’s developmental psychology, as expressed in \\nhis numerous writings, is essentially correct, and that we should expect to see afixed \\nsequence in demonstrated cognitive abilities that is age or grade level dependent. In \\ngeneral, the results of these studies do show an increasing cognitive capability from early \\nages (or grades) to later ages, but there is enormous variation at any grade or age level \\nand, as authors of the present papers show, for various cognitive tasks. Quite disturbing, \\nhowever, has been the repeated findings that some 20 to 80% of high school and/or college \\nstudents fail to demonstrate “formal” cognitive abilities as might have been expected \\nfrom Piaget’s original proposals. \\nThe results of the discouraging performance of high school and college students on \\n“formal” Piagetian tasks has led some science educators to suggest that we must develop \\ninstructional programs specifically to advance students from concrete operational thought \\nto formal thought. Some efforts to do this have reported modest success, and this pro- \\ncedure is advocated by Renner and Sutherland. The tacit assumption is that Piaget’s \\ntheory must be right and, therefore, we must train students to achieve formal operation \\nthinking if we wish to offer science instruction in subject matter that involves formal \\noperational thought, or eliminate such subject matter from the program. \\nThere is another alternative. As readers of Science Education know, this writer has \\nproposed that the Piagetian paradigm for interpreting cognitive studies is beginning to \\nhave too many exceptions and too many qualifiers [ 11. Adherence to the principle of \\nparsimony would suggest that some alternative explanatory model for cognitive learning \\nand instructional design is needed [2,3]. It is my hope that more researchers will consider \\nthe use of Ausubelian learning theory [4] as a basis for their research and for the design \\nof science instruction. To be sure Ausubel’s theory needs refinement, elaboration, and \\ngradual modification-all theories are useful only to the extent that they can be modified. \\nEventually, a more parsimonious theory of learning that has value and power for design \\nof science instruction will be proposed by some genius, and then we can go to work on \\nthat theory! \\n* See J.

Quite likely, the marked improve- \\nment in the quality of manuscripts is largely due to the positive approach presented to \\nauthors by the many who have refereed and edited articles, as well as by myself. We’ve \\nall tried to point out strengths as well as weaknesses, to state the basis for rejection if we \\nreturned a manuscript, and to give the authors a chance to revise their paper if some \\nmodification was needed. We’ve often rewritten portions of papers, but we have always \\nsought approval for any important changes. Most authors were pleased by the opportunity \\nfor even minor changes and appreciated this cooperative, positive approach to the pub- \\nlication of their paper. By this process many papers have been significantly improved. \\nAlmost half of the articles accepted have been revised to some extent. \\nMuch credit is due the Editorial Board-a highly select group of outstanding science \\neducators. This Board is a working board. Each member serves voluntarily and has spent \\ninnumerable hours refereeing and editing manuscripts. It is a stable board and provides \\na consistent direction to the development of the journal. \\nUnder the direction of the Board, four special sections have been instituted to sup- \\nplement the General Science Education Section: Science Teacher Education, Issues & \\nTrends, Learning, and International Science Education. A special Editorial Review Board \\nof AETS has refereed articles for the Science Teacher Education Section. The inclusion \\nof a Comments and Criticisms section proved necessary for an increased dialog with \\nscience educators. This may be looked upon as a crucible where truth is extracted from \\nthe exchange of ideas generated with the readers. \\nScience Education 62(3) 271-272 (1978) \\n0 1978 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 27 1 272 EDITORIAL \\nThe publisher has supported every professional innovation recommended by the Science \\nEducation Board and has demonstrated a dedication to service beyond commercial in- \\nterests.

NOVAK \\nNew York State College of Agriculture, \\nCornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850 \\nThe authors have done a careful analysis of some relevant literature dealing with \\nperformance of students on Piagetian tasks at or near the high school level. They wisely \\npoint out the limitation of studies on training effects on Piagetian performance when \\nretention tests are not administered, and that pretesting alone can produce a significant \\neffect on posttest results. However, the authors appear committed to the assumption that \\nPiaget’s developmental psychology is a valid basis for analyzing secondary school student’s \\nperformance and that the crucial factor for teaching important areas of science is the \\nextent to which students demonstrate Piagetian formal operations. \\nFor some years now this editor has been trying to suggest that the Piagetian paradigm \\nfor cognitive development is not the most useful paradigm to guide research in science \\neducation nor for planning of instructional programs. I cannot repeat my arguments here, \\nbut my students and I have tried to show in previous work that Ausubel’s theory of cog- \\nnitive learning can have more validity and more relevance to our work as researchers \\nand instructional planners. While it is useful to recognize the significance of general \\ncognitive structure differentiation signaled by student’s performance on Piagetian tasks, \\nwe should also recognize that we are primarily interested in cognitive learning issues that \\nover time result in the cognitive manifestations shown in Piagetian task performance. \\nAusubel’s early works[7,8] and hopefully a more understandable second edition[9] of \\n* DeCarcer, I.

The summary of studies provided by De Carcer, \\nGabel, and Staver shows well that to employ the paradigm of Piagetian developmental \\npsychology in the improvement of science teaching, leads one to less than optimism for \\nfuture science education of high school students if substantial content of a formal nature \\nis to be taught. Our own research, and the work of others, show that small but significant \\npercentages of elementary school children can succeed in science learning tasks of a formal \\nnature when they possess or are taught the relevant concepts for these tasks, and we see \\nindications of the same results in the reports summarized by the authors. \\nReferences \\n1.

This decision is reflected in paragraphs \\n5 and 6 of the revised Information for Contributors which appears on page 283 of this \\nissue. In making this change in the format of citations and references, Science Education \\njoins the growing number of publications in the behavioral sciences, the social sciences, \\nand education that have adopted some version of the so-called “APA Style.” Since most \\nreaders of the journal are affiliated either with education or with a behavioral or social \\nscience field, the use of APA Style in Science Education should be quite congenial. \\nIn the present issue, some papers appear which use the APA Style and some use the \\nnumerical referencing style that formerly was standard in this journal. The same mixture \\nof styles probably will also be found in papers in the next issue. We trust that readers will \\nunderstand the necessity for a transition period and will bear with us. When the decision \\nto follow the APA Style was reached, a number of accepted papers already were so far \\nalong in the editorial process that it was neither sensible nor economically feasible to make \\nthe stylistic changes. However, all newly accepted papers are being edited systematically \\nto change all citations and references to APA Style. By Issue 4 of Volume 63, the tran- \\nsition should be complete and all papers appearing in the journal should be stylistically \\nuniform. \\nAt this time, we want to urge authors submitting papers to Science Education for \\npublication consideration to use APA Style when preparing their manuscripts. Detailed \\nguidelines to the APA Style and many specific illustrations of manuscript formats for \\ncitations and references can be found in the Publication Manual ofthe American Psy- \\nchological Association, which has been widely distributed. Papers published in this \\njournal also should be consulted for examples of proper formats. \\nTo be sure, the editor and referees of Science Education will continue to evaluate papers \\nprimarily on the merit of their substantive content and on the comprehensiveness and \\naccuracy of citations from the literature. Nevertheless, we do believe that the consistent \\nuse of a uniform and informative style for citations can be an important adjunct to the \\neffective communication of ideas. The use of APA style should materially assist this \\nprocess. \\nL. E.

NOVAK \\nCornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853 \\nMali and Howe (1 979) are to be congratulated on a fine research study designed to \\nreplicate and extend work done in earlier studies. Repeatedly, critics of science-education \\nresearch have pointed out that there are rarely research studies that replicate earlier work, \\nand hence lead in time to a body of generalizable knowledge. This study by Mali and \\nHowe, taken together with Nussbaum’s (1979) replication and extension of his earlier \\nwork (Nussbaum & Novak, 1976), is beginning to show a general validity to Nussbaum’s \\n“notions” of the Earth concept. \\nAs regular readers of Science Education know, my overall interpretation of science- \\neducation literature leads me to favor an Ausubelian over a Piagetian theoretical \\nframework as an explanatory and heuristic model for science education (Novak, 1977a, \\n1977b). I find that the results of the study by Mali and Howe support my position in the \\nfollowing ways: \\n(1) The very substantial difference between US and Nepali (25% vs. 85%) eight-year-old \\nchildren exhibiting the most primitive notion of an Earth concept indicates the high degree of de- \\npendence of concept development in this area on specifically relevant experience and cognitive \\nlearning. This is strongly supportive of Ausubel’s (1 963, 1968, 1978) views on factors influencing \\ncognitive development. \\n(2) The lack of correlation between years of school and Piagetian task performance and the \\nsignificant correlations between years of schooling and “Earth notions” (Mali & Howe, 1979, \\nTable IV) indicate that more general cognitive capabilities measured by Piagetian tasks are not \\neasily influenced by school learning, but more specific cognitive competencies are highly influenced \\nby school learning (and other cultural inputs). Mali and Howe’s unwarranted assertion (implication \\n3, p. 690) that attainment of conservation is a necessary condition for attainment of higher notions \\nof Earth concept imputes a causality argument to a correlation coefficient. My own view of the \\nsignificant correlations between Earth notions and Piagetian task performance (Mali & Howe, \\n1979, Table 11) is that the latter tasks are coarse indicators of overall concept development and \\nhence should be expected to show correlation with other measures of specific concept development \\nand with age (Novak, 1977a, 1977b). \\n(3) The fact that there is little difference between Earth notions of children in the more urban \\nKathmandu region and the rural Pokhara region (Mali & Howe, 1979, Table 1)-both of which \\n* Mali, G.

As \\nsuggested at the 1979 meetings of the National Association for Research in Science \\nTeaching, any paradigm-based research is better than research with no guiding theoretical \\nframework. And perhaps studies that replicate and extend other paradigm-based research \\nare the most useful! Certainly the study by Mali and Howe merits careful analysis. \\nReferences \\nAusubel, D. P.

These \\nNSF programs were described in articles that appeared in previous issues of this journal. \\nThe criticisms should be of considerable interest to many science educators. \\nWe take this occasion to remind our readers that, if you have ideas to share on this topic \\nor any other topic discussed in articles in this journal, the pages of the Comments and \\nCriticism section are open for your contribution. However, several inquiries that we have \\nreceived suggest that some newer readers of Science Education may not be familiar with \\nhow the journal’s Comments and Criticism section is operated. The following explanation \\nshould resolve any perplexities. \\nThe intent of the Comments and Criticism section is to provide a forum for the ex- \\npression of different viewpoints and the correction of misunderstandings regarding topics \\nin papers published in the journal. It is assumed that the public discussion of diverse \\nviewpoints is an important and desirable ingredient of a healthy profession of science \\neducation. Because of the inevitable limitations on the journal’s available space, contri- \\nbutions for the Comments and Criticism section should be relatively brief, normally two \\nor four manuscript pages. Substantially longer manuscripts should be submitted as po- \\nsition papers for the Issues and Trends section. \\nUnlike full-length papers, a contribution for the Comments and Criticism section \\ngenerally is not sent out for review by the journal’s referees. However, a copy of the \\nmanuscript usually is sent to the author of the paper to which comments have been ad- \\ndressed for any response he or she might wish to make. (In the case of the three criticisms \\nof NSF science education programs that appear in the present issue, the authors of the \\noriginal descriptive articles elected not to make a response.) When an author’s response \\nis received, it is published with the instigating comment or criticism in the same issue \\nof the journal, insofar as our production schedule makes this possible. \\nOnce again, whenever you are moved to express your views on a topic treated in a paper \\nin Science Education, we invite you to pen a contribution for publication in the Comments \\nand Criticism section. \\nL. E. KLOPFER \\nEDITOR \\nI27 Editorial: What Should Be Published? \\nWhen authors submit more manuscripts to a journal than can be accommodated in \\nthe available page space, decisions must be made about which submitted papers to publish \\nand which to reject. In the case of Science Education, submissions continually exceed \\nthe journal’s available space by a considerable margin, so that “What should be pub- \\nlished?” is an ever-present question. \\nThe Editor and Editorial Board of Science Education have tried to resolve this question \\nby adopting the principle that only papers which represent a genuine contribution to the \\nliterature of science education should be published in the journal. To implement this \\nprinciple, we have been developing guidelines for determining what a “genuine contri- \\nbution” to the literature consists of. In their present form, these guidelines are stated as \\nconsiderations we expect the journal’s referees to bear in mind when reviewing submitted \\npapers. We reproduce these considerations here, because they probably are of interest \\nto our readers, who also are prospective authors of papers for Science Education. \\nThe first group of considerations for review applies to all papers, whether they take \\nthe form of an interpretive or descriptive essay or a report of research. These are con- \\nsiderations about the paper’s significance and organization and the quality of the writing. \\nSpecifically: \\n(1) \\n(2) \\n(3) \\n(4) \\n(5) The topic of the paper should have significance for the readers of Science Educa- \\ntion. \\nThe author should demonstrate awareness of previous discussions or/and studies related \\nto the paper’s topic. \\nThe paper should present information and ideas in a clearly organized form. \\nThe paper’s arguments should be logically consistent and interpretations should be \\nvalid. \\nLanguage should be exact and ideas should be expressed clearly. \\nThe second group of considerations applies only to papers which report research. Here \\nthe main concerns are that the report be informative and accurate and that it describes \\ncompetently executed research. The specific guidelines are: \\n(I) \\n(2) Sufficient descriptions, discussions, data, and analyses should be included in the report \\nfor the reader to make an informed judgment about the value of the research. \\nThe report should demonstrate that the procedures, methods of analysis, and safeguards \\nwere appropriate for the type of research being conducted (e.g., hypothesis-testing, \\nhistorical, survey, case study) and were used consistently and correctly. \\nPresentations of quantitative or qualitative data and analyses should be complete, clear, \\nand informative. \\nNot infrequently, an author will submit a paper which has merit but is deficient on \\none or more of the guidelines that the referees use. In that instance, our general practice \\nis to return the paper and request the author to make the necessary revisions to remedy \\nthe identified deficiencies. Given the opportunity to revise, most authors will produce \\nan improved paper which is more suitable for publication. (3) \\n57 9 580 EDITORIAL \\nOf course, the most that an editor or Editorial Board really can do is to nudge the \\nconscience of authors. The responsibility for assuring that only papers representing \\ngenuine contributions to the science education literature are published, in the last analysis, \\nrests with the writers of the papers. \\nL.

Some Board members thought that many researchers in science ed- \\nucation regularly consult these Summaries to keep abreast of current research activity \\nand results. Someone else thought that the annual Summaries are used chiefly by graduate \\nstudents who are doing literature surveys. Two other Board members suggested that the \\nSummaries may be used in science teacher education programs to acquaint students with \\nongoing research pertinent to instruction. And, one Board member felt that most sub- \\nscribers do not read the yearly Summary of Research at all and just file away the Science \\nEducation issue which carries it. \\nWe soon realized that, although we had opinions on the utilization of research reviews, \\nthere was no reliable information about how or how widely the annual Summaries in \\nScience Education are used. We agreed that it would be valuable to consult our readers \\nabout this. \\nI would be delighted to hear from any reader of Science Education who has information \\nabout the uses of the annually published research reviews or who wishes to comment on \\ntheir value. Please send your letter to me at the University of Pittsburgh, Learning Re- \\nsearch and Development Center, 3939 O’Hara Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15260. The in- \\nformation and comments you provide will help us to better serve the diverse needs of the \\njournal’s readership. Your suggestions also will be of great interest to the directors and \\nstaff of the ERIC/SMEAC who are instrumental in producing the annual research re- \\nviews. \\nFor the conscientious preparation of the present Summary of Research in Science \\nEducation for 1978, we are indebted to Dorothy L. Gabel, Martin H. Kagan, and Robert \\n0. Sherwood. This year’s contribution is the sixth of the current series of annual research \\nreviews to be published as a special issue of Science Education and the second to be in- \\ncorporated into the journal volume’s continuous pagination. \\nResponding to the editor’s suggestion, Alan M. Woelker, Thomas E. Thompson, and \\nBarry A. Van Deman prepared a supplementary article for this issue to update the pre- \\nviously published bibliographic compilations of science education research reviews. Not \\nmerely an update, their article is an organized and current guide to the varied research \\nreviewing enterprises in science education. In addition, their article provides some per- \\nspective on the uses of reviews of research. However, we still need to know more about \\nthis. Please share your knowledge and suggestions. \\nL. E. KLOPFER \\nEDITOR, Science Education \\nScience Education 64(4): 425 (1980) 425 Editorial: Furthering International \\nCommunication in Science Education \\nIt is characteristic of the natural sciences that the kinds of phenomena investigated \\nin the several disciplines are generally the same throughout the world. So, too, are the \\nsciences’ empirical laws, principles, and major theories. Because scientists in every nation \\nare concerned with common phenomena and ideas, they have long considered it valuable \\nto maintain good communications with one another on an international basis. Commu- \\nnication is facilitated through personal correspondence and visits, by participation in \\ninternational conferences, and, most importantly, through publication in books and \\njournals. Both the tradition and the mechanisms for the international exchange of in- \\nformation and ideas are well established in the sciences. \\nIn science education, it also is characteristic that the kinds of natural phenomena which \\nstudents learn about are, with only minor exceptions, the same throughout the world. \\nSo too are the empirical laws, principles, and major theories taught in science classes. \\nSince the teaching of the natural sciences everywhere touches on the same subject-matter, \\nscience educators in every nation have much in common with their colleagues in other \\ncountries, despite some differences in customs and language. However, the tradition of \\ninternational communication in science education is not nearly so strong as in the sciences, \\nnor are the facilitative mechanisms for maintaining good communication so well devel- \\noped. \\nIn the belief that better international communication will benefit science educators \\nin much the same way it serves scientists, we are now taking steps to improve the mutual \\nsharing of information and ideas through this journal among science educators worldwide. \\nInstrumental in that effort is John P. Smith, the new editor of our International Science \\nEducation section. This section in the present issue of Science Education carries a sig- \\nnificant report on “Science Education in the U.S.S.R.,” by Charles P. McFadden. In \\nthe next issue, we plan to publish a report on the current status of “Pre-college biology \\nteaching in the People’s Republic of China,” by Paul DeHart Hurd. \\nThese two reports were prepared by visitors from North America to the respective \\ncountries, but our aim of enhancing two-way international communication will not be \\nachieved unless more papers by authors within various countries appear in Science Ed- \\nucation. To promote manuscript submissions from different countries, John Smith is \\nforming a group of regional Contributing Editors, who will solicit both research reports \\nand analytical papers from colleagues in their world regions and will help to assure that \\nthe submitted manuscripts meet the journal’s quality standards. Two persons have already \\nagreed to serve in this capacity, and we are pleased to welcome these Contributing Editors \\nfor the regions indicated: \\nProfessor M. B. Ogunniyi, University of lbadan (Western Africa) \\nProfessor A. D. Turner, University of London (British Isles). \\nWe plan to add other foreign Contributing Editors for various regions until an effec- \\ntive world coverage is attained. One particular objective is to be able to publish high quality papers from science educators in countries which are now unrepresented or only \\nsparsely represented in Science Education. (For technical reasons, the language of the \\njournal will continue to be English.) Regardless of their country of origin, submitted \\nmanuscripts which deal with a topic pertinent to one of the journal’s special sections will, \\nif accepted, appear in that section. Analytical or interpretive papers on science education \\nprograms and practices in a particular country, and reports on comparative studies of \\naspects of science teaching across several countries normally will appear in the Inter- \\nnational Science Education section. \\nBy putting these mechanisms in place for Science Education, we hope that this journal \\ncan make a worthwhile contribution to furthering international communication in science \\neducation. \\nNew Section Editors \\nIn addition to the already mentioned appointment of John P. Smith as editor of the \\nInternational Science Education section, we are pleased to announce these new editors \\nof the special sections: \\nMary Budd Rowe \\nJames Joseph Gallagher \\nJames R. Okey Learning \\nScience Teacher Education \\nIssues & Trends \\nWe can anticipate that the respective sections will continue to prosper and grow under \\neach editor’s stewardship. At the same time, it is a pleasure to thank the special section \\neditors whose tenure of office is ending: Patricia E. Blosser (Science Teacher Education \\nsection), Joseph D. Novak (Learning section), Fletcher G. Watson (International Science \\nEducation section). Each has served the journal well, and Science Education is better \\nfor their efforts. \\nIn Appreciation \\nThe responsibility of refereeing manuscripts submitted for publication continues to \\nbe shared by many persons. During the past year, those who served as referees for Science \\nEducation include: Glen S. Aikenhead, Betsy A. Balzano, Marjorie H. Bingham, N. \\nE. Bingham, Patricia E. Blosser, Audrey B.

Despite national differences in languages and contrasting customs, science \\nand the teaching of science share common interests and common problems throughout \\nthe world. Facing common problems, science educators everywhere could certainly benefit \\nfrom knowing more about the pertinent ideas of their colleagues in other countries and \\nabout the research being done to attack the issues of concern. \\nHowever, as we noted in a previous editorial, international communication in science \\neducation is not all it might be. We are pleased, therefore, to make a modest contribution \\ntoward alleviating this situation by publishing in this issue a directory of research institutes \\nand centers for science education in Europe, compiled by Dr. Klaus Blansdorf. It can \\nbe argued that a key requisite for addressing the science educators in the international \\nresearch community is to know who they are and to have their addresses. Having this \\ndirectory for Europe may go a long way toward meeting that need. \\nWe are also pleased that it has become possible to publish the annual “Summary of \\nResearch in Science Education” several months earlier than heretofor. This is a minor \\nbenefit from the introduction of word-processing technology and other improvements \\nat ERIC/SMEAC. It is our plan to publish the research summary as issue 3 of each \\nvolume of Science Education from now on and to distribute this issue in June each year. \\nThe publication schedule for the other four issues of the journal remains unchanged. \\nL.

E. KLOPFER \\nEditor Editorial: Discussions of Issues in Science \\nEducation \\nThere is little need to remind most readers of this journal about the sea of troubles now \\nsurrounding science education in the United States. Ironically, at the very time when \\nstrong positive movements should be evident to assure the development of everyone’s \\ncapacity to cope with the science and technology-based world of the 21 st century, science \\neducation is hampered by the withdrawal of financial support, curtailment of instructional \\nresources, some severe shortages of qualified teachers, and an antagonistic or generally \\ndisinterested public. These are serious issues. Unless they are sensibly resolved, the future \\ngood health of science education in this country cannot be assured. \\nThis journal proposes to make some contribution to the resolution of the issues affecting \\nthe future of science education by making increased space available over the coming \\nmonths for the expression of informed views and discussions of pertinent issues. Our Issues \\nand Trends section will be expanded, so that more articles of more persons who hold \\nplausible views concerning any issue confronting science education can be published. \\nWe would encourage every reader to whom this characterization applies to prepare a \\nwell-reasoned expression of his or her viewpoint and submit the article for publication \\nconsideration in the expanded Issues and Trends section. \\nTo facilitate the publication of appropriate papers, Robert W. Howe has accepted the \\nresponsibility of serving as the new Issues and Trends section editor. We hope to expedite \\nthe publication of papers accepted for this section so that their appearance in the journal \\nwill be timely. Also, we expect to include papers that express both the views of science \\neducators and the viewpoints of other educators and responsible persons in business, in- \\ndustry, and government. \\nTo herald the increased focus on discussions of current issues in the pages of Science \\nEducation, we are publishing in the present issue of the journal an article entitled “State \\nof Precollege Education in Mathematics and Science,” by Paul DeHart Hurd. This \\nstatement should help to set the scene for the extended discussions of issues in science \\neducation that will follow. \\nL. E. KLOPFER \\nEditor Editorial: Research and the Crisis in \\nScience Education \\nThe annual Summary of Research in Science Education published in this issue of the \\njournal represents, as always, the varied research activities of many persons. The record \\nof their research reports presented in 1981 on diverse aspects of science learning and \\nteaching is impressive. But, it also raises two nagging questions: Has the research com- \\npleted in 198 1 made much difference in what is happening in science classrooms in 1983? \\nHow will this research, or any of our science education research, help to resolve the current \\ncrisis in science education? \\nThese two questions obviously are related. Considering first the current science edu- \\ncation crisis, we can readily recognize three principal constituents. To begin, at both the \\nnational level and in many local schools, a general lack of confidence in science education \\nhas become increasingly evident in recent years. This stance is expressed in such actions \\nas relegating science instruction to a secondary place in the curriculum, particularly in \\nelementary and middle schools, and withholding or curtailing funds for science facilities, \\ninstructional materials, curriculum development, equipment, and supplies. The failure \\nto exhibit confidence in science education on the part of school boards, businessmen, and \\npoliticians, not to mention numerous parents, comes at a time when many science edu- \\ncators are themselves questioning the adequacy of the science instruction children receive \\nin school. The results of three successive National Assessments of Educational Progress \\nin Science between 1969 and 1976 and the findings of other studies collated through \\nProject Synthesis in 1978 have shown that more students than the nation can tolerate \\nare failing to achieve a satisfactory understanding of important science concepts and \\nprinciples or sufficient competence in inquiry processes. Finally, the third major con- \\nstituent of the science education crisis is a serious shortfall in the number of fully qualified \\nscience and mathematics teachers in most of the states. A shortage of competent science \\nteachers is always a cause for concern, but when it coincides with the other issues that \\nnow beset science education, we know that we are facing a grave crisis. \\nWhat bearing does the research summarized in this issue have on the current crisis? \\nWith respect to the shortage of science teachers, the kinds of research done by science \\neducators tell us very little, and we must look elsewhere for ideas that may help to resolve \\nthis constituent of the crisis. But, if we want to improve the quality of science instruction, \\nthe results of our research on the learning and teaching of science ought to, in principle, \\noffer some guidance. However, it is doubtful that the lessons that practitioners of science \\neducation in schools learn from research are very great. One of the serious problems of \\nour field is that research rarely impacts practice, taking exception for those instances \\nwhere a researcher (often in the guise of graduate student) is also the practitioner. The \\nrealistic answer to the first nagging question about the extent that findings of 1981 re- \\nsearch are reflected in 1983 classrooms is: not very much. \\nThe reasons underlying this situation are complex, but the shortcoming of science \\nScience Education 67(3): 283-284 (1983) \\n0 1983 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. CCC 0036-8326/83/030283-02$01.20 284 KLOPFER \\neducation research in significantly affecting school practice is real. Perhaps the research \\nis too dispersed, treating too many topics unsystematically or superficially. Perhaps much \\nof the research is not carried out within the framework of a sufficiently powerful paradigm \\nthat serves to coordinate findings and gives direction to new investigations. Perhaps there \\nis some careless work which is not sufficiently critiqued and some hurried or sloppy \\nworkers who are not brought to account. Perhaps we simply have not taken the time to \\nthink through conscientiously the various implications of research findings for science \\ninstruction. \\nIf we mend our ways and treat science education research with the seriousness it de- \\nserves, there can be no guarantee, of course, that it will suddenly become more significant \\nfor practice. Nonetheless, the effort seems warranted. If it succeeds, an important con- \\ntribution will be made toward improving the quality of science instruction. Better, more \\nsuccessful science learning of students will restore the public’s confidence in science \\neducation. We then may see the amelioration of the crisis in science education. \\nL. E.

We feel that the welfare of our country depends upon the education of our \\npeople. \\nIn an effort to improve the system of education in the United States, we feel that one \\nof the country’s first goals should be to increase the prestige of the teaching profession. \\nPerhaps this goal could be fulfilled by upgrading the school of education degree quali- \\nfications and increasing the monetary benefits which are available to worthy teachers \\nin all areas of education. \\nIn addition, we believe that encouraging industry to become involved in the education \\nof their future employees is an essential step in the advancement of primary and secondary \\neducation. \\nWe feel that improvements are necessary because, throughout our education, we have \\nexperienced many injustices. A member of this institute was “taught” physics by a teacher \\nwho majored in physical education. We have all seen special academic programs disappear \\nfrom our school systems as the athletic programs continued to thrive. The funding for \\nmany educational summer programs, such as this one, has continued to drop, or in some \\ncases no longer exists. In addition, apathy seems to be prevalent among students and \\nteachers. Though many of the problems we have stated are not present in all school sys- \\ntems, we feel that there is a need for betterment in most schools across the country. \\nScience Education 67(5): 549-552 (1983) \\n0 1983 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The \\nreports are unanimous in saying that, in today’s society, all young people must have \\nample opportunities for learning to understand science and the scientific ways of \\nthinking. This is a necessity for all young people, not only those moving toward \\nscientific or science-related careers, but for everyone. \\nIt’s significant that these recommendations are not coming from committees com- \\nposed primarily of scientists and science educators, who have frequently made such \\nproclamations in the past. No, the National Commission on Excellence in Education \\nsponsored by the U.S. Department of Education; the Task Force on Education for \\nEconomic Growth appointed by the Educational Commission of the States; the \\nCommission on Precollege Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology \\nappointed by the National Science Board; and the National High School Board \\nsponsored by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching all represented \\na spectrum of informed opinion among the American public. There were leading \\nbusiness executives, educators, economists, humanists, social scientists, natural \\nscientists, and other public figures. These broadly informed persons now advocate \\nan increased emphasis on science education for all young people. Most science \\neducators would agree with that goal. It’s nice to know that science education now \\nhas some friends who were not there before. \\nThe new friends of science education, many of whom represent the experiences \\nand realities of the world at large, have a more pragmatic rationale for emphasizing \\nscience education than the rationale science educators are wont to give. An analysis \\nof the recommendations in the several commission reports was made by my colleague, \\nAudrey Champagne, and presented in an address to the Oregon School Boards \\nAssociation convention on 4 November 1983. She found that these reports reflect \\ntwo major shifts from earlier documents in the stated function of schools. First, \\nthere is a shift from perceiving the schools as agents of social and political change \\nto the view of the schools as providing young people with the proper preparation \\nfor life. Second is a shift from emphasizing the welfare of individuals to an emphasis \\non national needs and the collective good of the society. Thus, elementary and \\nsecondary school education is seen as preparing young people for both productive \\nand responsible citizenship. It should also provide high school graduates with skills \\nthat will enable them to continue their education, either in work-related training or \\nin further study leading to professional careers or through life-long learning. \\nThis set of priorities and goals presents a considerable challenge to science educators. \\nFrom time to time, many of us have thought about the contributions which science \\neducation might make to the preparation of young people for life in a rapidly changing \\nScience Education 68( 1): 1 -2( 1984) \\n0 1984 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

But, the truth is that we \\nnow don’t have any fully developed science courses or programs which we know \\ncan accomplish that complex educational task in the variety of existing school \\nsituations. If we are to meet the educational challenge of the present decade, new \\nforms of science education will have to be devised. \\nThe new forms of science education may turn out to be quite different from the \\nscience instruction we’ve become accustomed to. Some of the content will surely \\nbe different. The settings for learning may also be unfamiliar, and novel organizations \\nof instruction may be employed. Certainly, such innovations would pose a host of \\nimplementation problems. It’s evident that the coming years in science education \\nare not likely to be dull, as we create and develop the new forms that are needed. \\nIf we move wisely, we could make some more new friends for science education \\nin the process. \\nL.

Ordinarily, in the editorial process, I deal with \\nmanuscripts singly or in small batches, so that patterns respecting authorship are not \\nreadily apparent. However, when the papers we accepted for publication in Science \\nEducation during 1985 were all together, anyone could see that nearly two-fifths of them \\noriginated outside the United States. For a journal that both began its life and spent most \\nof its adult years focusing on U.S. science education, this represents a remarkable change. \\nThe increasing proportion of papers by non-U.S. authors in Science Education probably \\nreflects a change in the science education enterprise itself. Some of the papers that we \\npublish from colleagues in various countries concern issues peculiar to a particular locale. \\nHowever, most of the papers deal with the profession’s central concerns that are repre- \\nsented in this journal’s sections-students’ science learning, science teacher education, \\nscience curriculum organization and science assessment instruments. What this means is \\nthat our paper authors, regardless of their country of origin, are increasingly addressing, \\nthinking about and conducting investigations concerning a common core of science edu- \\ncation questions and problems. This may reflect a strong trend in the science education \\nenterprise toward a general consensus among its worldwide practitioners about the relevant \\nphenomena, events and structures which are worth discussing and investigating. To some \\nextent, there even is cross-national consensus on the appropriate means for investigating \\nproblems in science education. I think it is fair to say that such a high degree of consensus \\nhas not ever been evident before. \\nIn virtually every field of the natural sciences, there is general agreement among \\npractitioners about the kinds of phenomena and problems that can fruitfully be studied. \\nThese agreements and the fact that the phenomena for study are universally available to \\nsuitably motivated inquirers make it possible to pursue each science in diverse geographic \\nand cultural environments and to transcend national boundaries. As a result, most of the \\nnatural sciences have evolved into truly international enterprises with people from many \\ncountries contributing cooperatively to their advancement. \\nWith a growing consensus about the central phenomena and problems of the field and \\nwith its phenomena universally accessible for inquiry, science education now appears to \\nbe steadfastly evolving into a truly international enterprise. We can foresee that practi- \\ntioners from many countries having diverse geographic and cultural environments will \\ncooperatively contribute ever more to the advance of science education in the years to \\ncome. A continuing commitment of this journal is to support and foster this evolution. \\nL. E. Klopfer, Editor \\nScience Education 70(2): 91 (1986) \\n0 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The occasion \\nmight be a temptation to launch an effusive essay about the journal having attained \\nits biblically allotted lifespan and about the prospects for its future. In fact, however, \\nthis issue is simply another link in a lengthy chain which extends back for quite a \\nwhile and which probably will extend forward for many more years. \\nWhen this journal began in 1916 as the General Science Quarterly, its founders \\nthought that the articles to be published should contribute to improving both the \\npractice and the theory of science education. Through many vicissitudes and chang- \\ning fashions, this purpose of Science Education has remained essentially the same \\nover the years. Today, the Editor and Editorial Board try to abide by the principle \\nthat only papers which represent a genuine contribution to the literature of science \\neducation should be published in the journal. To implement this principle, we have \\ndeveloped guidelines for determining what a “genuine contribution” to the liter- \\nature consists of. The present guidelines are stated as considerations we expect the \\njournal’s referees to bear in mind when reviewing submitted papers, and they are \\nreprinted here. \\nThe first group of considerations for review applies to all papers, whether they \\ntake the form of an interpretative or descriptive essay or a report of research. \\nThese are considerations about the paper’s significance and organization and the \\nquality of the writing. Specifically: \\n1. The topic of the paper should have significance for the readers of Science Edu- \\n2. The author should demonstrate awareness of previous discussions and/or studies \\n3. The paper should present information and ideas in a clearly organized form. \\n4. The paper’s arguments should be logically consistent and interpretations should \\n5.

The specific guidelines are: \\n1. Sufficient descriptions, discussions, data, and analyses should be included in the \\nreport for the reader to make an informed judgment about the value of the \\nresearch. \\n2. The report should demonstrate that the procedures, methods of analysis, and \\nsafeguards were appropriate for the type of research being conducted (e.g., \\nhypothesis-testing, historical, survey, case study) and were used consistently and \\ncorrectly. \\nScience Education 71(1): 1-2 (1987) \\n0 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Presentations of quantitative or qualitative data and analyses should be com- \\nplete, clear, and informative. \\nNot infrequently, an author will submit a paper which has merit but is deficient \\non one or more of the guidelines that the referees use. In that instance, our general \\npractice is to return the paper and request the author to make the necessary revisions \\nto remedy the identified deficiencies. Given the opportunity to revise, most authors \\nwill produce an improved paper which is more suitable for publication. \\nWe hope that our guidelines will be of help to prospective authors of papers for \\nScience Education. Following the guidelines should enhance the probability that a \\npaper will become a genuine contribution to the literature of science education. \\nIn Appreciation \\nThe diligent work of the journal’s referees, who provide the critical and careful \\nreviews of submitted manuscripts, goes largely unsung.

For twelve years Leopold Klopfer has been at \\nthe helm of Science Education, a scholarly journal that many believe is one of the \\ntop international publications reporting science education research results, issues, \\nand trends. During his tenure as editor, the field of science education and science \\neducational research has undergone dynamic changes. Here and now I want to \\nmake the claim that much of what became possible in science education did so \\nbecause of the vision this man had about what was important in science education. \\nPersonally, he helped to pioneer the use of historical cases of science in secondary \\nschool programs; a curriculum perspective that is now finally receiving its due \\nrecognition in AAAS’s Projecf 2061. With William Cooley, he developed and \\nvalidated the widely used “Test on Understanding Science.” Along with his col- \\nleague and long-time collaborator in science education research at the Learning \\nResearch and Development Center (LRDC) Audrey Champagne, he participated \\nin some of the earliest investigations of misconceptions research and the use of \\nconcept maps as dependent measures of student learning in science. More recently, \\nthrough his association with Leona Schauble he has participated in fundamental \\ndevelopmental psychology research on how children reason scientifically. In short, \\nhe led the field by his actions. \\nAs a profession we have benefited from his first-hand participation in research \\nand from his associations with LRDC and/or University of Pittsburgh School of \\nEducation colleagues like Robert Glaser, Lauren Resnick, Gaea Leinhardt , James \\nGreeno, Catherine Cornbleth, James Pellegrino, Stellan Ohlsson, Nancy Cole, \\nJames Voss, Isabel Beck, Charles Perfetti, Lloyd Bond, William Cooley, Alan \\nLesgold, Edward Silver, and Michelene Chi-all internationally recognized scholars \\nin their respective fields. From such participation and associations he has been able \\nto inform and guide us about what is and, perhaps more importantly, what should \\nbe important in education research. He provided and still provides a vision honed \\nfrom his own work and from the work of his colleagues. Readers of and contributors \\nto this journal have over the years benefited from his vision and commitment. I \\nconsider myself fortunate indeed that my career has brought me to the University \\nof Pittsburgh and to the same environment that helped nurture the vision of Leo. \\nMy challenge is to sustain the level of quality set by my mentor, colleague, and \\nfriend. \\nScience Education 77(2): 113-1 14 (1993) \\nC 1993 John Wiley gi Sons, Inc.

But there is one element of Scierice Educurioii that cannot \\nbe faulted and it is perhaps the most important element of any scholarly journal. \\nThat element is the overall quality of the manuscripts that were published in the \\njournal during his tenure as editor.

Analyses of science education phenomena or syntheses of a \\nwell argued position (directly relevant to elementary or secondary science educa- \\ntion) may be framed by a perspective from other disciplines, thereby presenting a \\nnew way to think about some familiar facet of science education. Topics might \\ninclude, but are not limited to: philosophy, sociology, and history of science or of \\nscience education; science and technology education; schooling; curriculum; in- \\nstruction; STS; literacy; governmental educational policies; innovations; debates \\nwithin the science education community; research methodologies; and assessment \\nand evaluation. For instance, a sociological analysis of schooling could address a \\ngeneral topic such as multiculturalism, or a more specific topic such as the ideology \\nand social function of the physics curriculum in schools. \\nA scholarly article is expected to: attend to the literature pertinent to the issue, \\npresent quantitative or qualitative empirical evidence whenever appropriate, be \\nclearly written, be logically organized, and come to a well warranted conclusion. \\nA review article, per se, does not fit this description, although within any I&T \\narticle there will invariably be a review of pertinent literature. \\nManuscripts to be reviewed should meet minimum technical requirements; for \\nexample: legible, double spaced, numbered pages, no footnotes, and generally in \\nthe current APA style.

BITNET \\nPURPOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE \\nEDUCATION SECTION \\nThis section serves as a forum for the critical discussion of cultural, sociological, \\nand political influences on all aspects of science education. Its purpose is to bring \\na cross-cultural and international perspective to science education that will broaden \\nthe awareness within the community of science educators, wherever they may be, \\nthat science education is a global activity. \\nIn pursuit of this purpose, the section editors wish to solicit a broad range of \\ninternational manuscripts along the following lines: \\nScholarly work currently published in English is largely available to the \\nreadership of Science Education through several sources including Science \\nEducation. Such is not the case with scholarly work written in languages \\nother than English. The International section will thus specifically solicit \\nscholarly reviews in English of work originally written in other languages. \\nGiven the Western roots of modern science and modern science education, \\nthe International section wishes to feature work from non-Western countries \\ndealing with the interaction between culture and science. \\nThe West is known for its advanced state of science and technology which \\nis viewed as a critical element that supports the West’s advanced economies. \\nLess economically developed countries promote science and technological \\neducation as a way of advancing their own economic conditions. The Inter- \\nnational section wishes to solicit both research and policy articles that seek \\nto advance understanding of the relationship between science and technol- \\nogy, education, and economic development in countries around the globe. \\nScience Education 78(3): 217-220 (1994) \\n0 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. CCC 0036-8326/94/030217-04 EDITORIAL POLICY STATEMENTS 21 8 \\n4. \\n5. \\n6. \\n7. Education can never be divorced from politics for long and, given the political \\nflux in which much of the world today finds itself, the International section \\nwishes to promote scholarly dialogue on science, science education, and \\ngovernment. \\nScience education research and practice make use of theoretical frame- \\nworks; however, the Western origin of most of this theoretical work raises \\nquestions about how culturally transferable any theory in education can \\nactually be. The International section takes no position on these questions \\nother than that their answers ought not to be assumed uncritically. The \\nsection thus wishes to promote the scholarly discussion of theory and culture. \\nThe current literature in science education features several sociocultural \\nconcepts such as multiculturalism and gender. The literature contains reports \\nof research based on these concepts conducted in both Western and non- \\nWestern societies. The International section wishes to promote such scholarly \\nwork whenever that work seeks to provide a local perspective on sociocultural \\nconcepts rather than only reflecting the uncritical acceptance of foreign def- \\ninitions. \\nThe section editors recognize the potentially controversial nature of the \\nabove agenda. Thus, in addition to the journal’s standard format for manu- \\nscripts, the International section also will offer opportunities for point-coun- \\nterpoint manuscripts from two contributors, multiple short responses to a \\nmajor manuscript defending a controversial position, and for manuscript sets \\naddressing an issue from various perspectives. \\nSOLICITATION AND REVIEW OF MANUSCRIPTS \\nTwo difficult problems confront any attempt to develop a genuinely international \\nsection. There is first the problem of soliciting manuscripts from around the globe, \\nand second the problem of language. The language of the journal is English but \\nmany of those from whom we would wish to receive manuscripts know English \\nonly as a foreign language. Many scholars simply do not know of the journal and, \\nwhen they do, there is still the problem of producing a scholarly manuscript in a \\nforeign language. To lower these hurdles, the section editors will work closely with \\na group of contributing editors strategically named to represent different regions \\nof the globe. The contributing editors will help disseminate journal information to \\nscholars beyond the journal’s range of circulation and help to recruit new contrib- \\nutors of manuscripts. The contributing editors will also have the authority to conduct \\nthe first level review of manuscripts, sending on to the editor only those manuscripts \\nthey deem to be both appropriate and of good quality. Manuscripts from non- \\nnative English speakers need not be in final draft form. The journal will accept \\nmanuscripts as long as they are typed or printed in passable English. The section \\neditors will then seek scholars willing to help non-native English speakers bring \\ntheir manuscripts into final publication form. In deciding when to offer editing \\nhelp, the section editors will rely heavily on the judgment of the contributing \\neditors. \\n 1098237x, 1994, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730780305 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The STE section shall include \\nphilosophical, conceptual, and empirical articles that promote excellence in schol- \\narship, policy, and practices in STE. The term science teacher education is inclusive \\nof the initial preparation and the continuing professional development of science \\nteachers. \\nRELATIONSHIP TO THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION OF \\nTEACHERS IN SCIENCE (AETS) \\nThe journal has had a relationship with AETS for many decades. The Association \\nand its publications committee have an important voice in formulating STE section \\nand journal policy; the committee has a role in identifying and approving the STE \\nsection editor(s). The AETS/STE Editorial Review Board participates in the so- \\nlicitation and review of manuscripts published in the STE section. Commentary \\nfrom the reviewers is forwarded anonymously to authors submitting articles and is \\nan important part of the current review and feedback process. \\nSPECIAL GOALS OF THE STE COEDITORS \\nSection Foci \\nThe new section coeditors want to increase the breadth and depth of scholarship \\nthat can enhance policy, practice, and research in STE. Through manuscript so- \\nlicitation efforts and comprehensive review processes, the coeditors wish to promote \\nthe power of thoughtfully designed inquiry in studying complex issues associated \\nScience Education 78(3): 209-211 (1994) \\n0 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

To that end, they hope to increase the number \\nof manuscripts which report research guided by appropriate yet varied research \\nmethods, e.g., large data base, survey, historical, case study, quasi-experimental, \\nethnographic, etc. \\nThey also hope to increase the breadth of scholarly questions addressed in the \\nnational and international STE literature. Policy, equity, diversity, national stan- \\ndards, certification, ethics, supervision, school-university partnerships, and other \\nreform issues are very visible in the contemporary education literature and have \\nimplications for STE. What are the connections between these issues and STE? \\nResearch in the cognitive sciences has stimulated much discussion associated with \\nthe notion that learning is a constructive process. In what ways is this perspective \\nbeing studied and applied in the education of teachers of science? What has been \\nlearned about science teachers’ conceptual development from this perspective? For \\ninstance, reform of STE delivery systems and institutions is implicit in commentary \\nassociated with Holmes Group and NCATE initiatives and in the gulf that continues \\nto separate many in the science and science education communities. How are science \\nteacher education activities responding to these initiatives and issues and what have \\nbeen the results? Criticism of the teaching of school science continues to be wide- \\nspread. In addition, there are serious tensions between forces calling for increased \\ndisciplinary depth and for increased interdisciplinarity both in the academic dis- \\nciplines and in education. How can research in the learning of science inform \\nresearch, policy, and practices in science teaching? The section coeditors recognize \\nthat issues in science teacher education are complex, and that meaningful progress \\nwill occur when STE policy and practices are informed by rigorous and relevant \\nscholarship. \\nThere are growing bodies of scholarly literature in teacher education, cognition, \\ncurriculum theory, policy studies, philosophy of science, et al., as well as in science \\neducation that have special implications for STE. To that end, the section editors \\nwish to solicit an increased number of manuscripts that intersect relevant literature \\nfrom outside the bounds of science education to explore important dimensions of \\nSTE that have not been especially visible in the STE literature. \\nDialogue \\nThe section editors intend to stay in close contact with the science education \\ncommunity and especially with the AETS and NARST memberships. They will \\ncommunicate through a column in the AETS newsletter and will conduct sessions \\nat the AETS annual meetings and other science education meetings to discuss STE \\nsection policy and practices. They will encourage communication and dialogue on \\nSTE scholarly issues, on articles published in the section, and on the STE section \\npolicy. One principal medium currently envisioned for that dialogue is electronic \\nmail. To that end, as well as concerning the STE section in general, the STE section \\ncoeditors welcome e-mailed suggestions, comments, and questions. \\nSTANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP \\nThe highest standards of scholarship will be upheld for the articles accepted for \\npublication in the STE section.

Research goals and questions should be clearly \\nidentified at the outset of the article and be visible in the article’s conclusions and \\nimplications. If treatments were a part of the study, they should be discussed with \\ncare. Conceptual and theoretical frameworks are expected to be described in detail \\nand reflected throughout the manuscript in a coherent manner. Validation and \\nreliability issues should be addressed wherever appropriate. Implications for teacher \\neducation practice, policy, and research are expected to be explicated as an integral \\npart of every manuscript submitted for publication. \\nSUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCESS \\nManuscripts submitted for possible publication in the STE section of Science \\nEducation follow submission and review procedures that are similar to those of the \\nother sections of the journal. After it is submitted to the editor, a prospective STE \\narticle is reviewed by individuals on the journal’s Board of Reviewers and by \\nreferees from the AETS/STE Editorial Review Board. The author of an article \\nsubmitted for inclusion in the STE section should indicate in the cover letter to \\nthe Science Education editor that he or she believes the article is appropriate for \\ninclusion in the STE section. Copies of reviewers’ comments will be returned to \\nthe author(s) with a cover letter from the journal editor. Potential STE manuscript \\nauthors should follow the most recent advice published for all contributors to the \\njournal. \\n 1098237x, 1994, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730780303 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Xoh XXIII sln 15704, \\nUniversidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain \\nMy initial remark about the Editor’s statement (Duschl, 1994) is that it is good to \\nhave the editorial policy of Science Education made explicit. To state the rules \\nopenly is fair play. I hold analogous feelings about classroom discourse, and initial \\nand inservice teacher education, as it is my belief that a number of educational prob- \\nlems arise from the fact that students are often in the dark about the objectives their \\nteachers set, and have to guess the purpose of a lesson or practical task. In the same \\nway, it is fair that the standards against which a manuscript is going to be judged are \\nknown by everyone, not just the reviewers. For this reason, the section editors’ state- \\nments are also welcome. \\nDuschI’s editorial contains a good number of ideas tightly packed in a few pages, \\nlike particles in a high density solid. However, one would like to see some of them de- \\nveloped; to know, for instance, what he thinks about the “new goals, standards, and \\naims” for education and educational research, or which “agendas problems and ques- \\ntions must be abandoned.” The answers to some of these concerns are implicit in his \\nstatement where, for instance, problem selection is discussed, but other questions may \\nconstitute a matter for future debate about science education research. The editorial, \\nhowever, being also concerned with research, focuses particularly on the question of \\nwriting research reports. The two issues are related, of course, as it is impossible to \\nwrite good reports about poor research (although it is possible to write poor reports \\nabout good research). My remarks also focus on writing-and reading-reports of re- \\nsearch, but it is my hope that they will serve to initiate a deeper debate about research. \\nMy comment first concerns the emerging research community. The issue of the \\ntwo groups of researchers that Duschl speaks to in his editorial is one that has been \\ndiscussed in Spain among my colleagues (JosC Otero, Daniel Gil, and others) and I \\nScience Education 79(6): 701 -704 (1995) \\n0 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In 1993, for example, a special issue of Infancia y \\nAprendizaje (a Spanish journal devoted to developmental and educational psychol- \\nogy) focused on the relations among researchers from the fields of content-specific \\ndomains (e.g., science education, social studies, arts education, etc.) and educational \\npsychology. Certainly I agree with Duschl’s recommendation to science educators \\nabout the need to include other journals (besides those devoted solely to science edu- \\ncation) as part of their regular readings; clearly, part of the work reported in them has \\nprovided powerful insights into science education problems. I would argue, however, \\nthat biased readings do not inhere exclusively in Group 1. For instance, as a Group 1 \\nresearcher interested in conceptual change issues, I have noticed that papers and \\nbooks on this issue from Group 2 researchers tend to mainly cite papers from science \\neducators published in journals such as Instructional Science or Cognition and \\nInstruction, or to disregard other work. I do not suggest ignoring them, since I be- \\nlieve we would benefit from their research. My point is that we, researchers from \\nGroup 1, should make an effort to connect with Group 2 researchers and, at the same \\ntime, find ways to suggest to them the benefits of connecting with Group 1. Perhaps \\nthis strategy would involve more science educators not only including these “other” \\njournals as part of their readings, but also considering them as possible venues for \\npublishing their research reports. \\nAt the end of his editorial, Duschl refers to the things that are happening in other \\nresearch communities, classrooms and schools, and in other countries. This reminds \\nus, as foreign readers, that Science Education is an American journal, something that \\none can easily lose sight of because of the journal’s broad scope and variety of in- \\nternational contributions. When reading articles published in the prominent American \\njournals, however, and comparing them to articles published in Europe and Australia, \\none gets the impression- specifically through comparison of the articles’ bibliogra- \\nphies -that there is a significant qualitative difference between them: Articles pub- \\nlished in European and Australian journals include references from a variety of ori- \\ngins, while a significant number of articles published in American journals seem to \\n 1098237x, 1995, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730790608 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

In order to verify if this was a subjective impression, I \\nscreened recent (July 1994) issues of three leading journals, excluding special issues, \\nwith the results shown in Table I. \\nReferences are categorized as follows: (a) journal articles; this group has been fur- \\nther broken down into: (a.i) articles published in the same journal, (a.ii) articles pub- \\nlished in other North American science education journals, (a.iii) articles published in \\nother non-North American science education journals, (a.iv) articles published in ed- \\nucational journals classified under Duschl’s Group 2 category, and (a.v) articles pub- \\nlished in journals from other disciplines; (b) books, dissertations, occasional papers, \\nor associations documents; and (c) papers from conferences, annual meetings, or pro- \\nceedings. \\nAs seen in Table 1, the proportion of North American references is high in the \\nthree journals, including the U.K.-based International Journal of Science Education \\n(IJSE). In contrast, the number of non-North American references in both American \\njournals is low. The self-reference concern does not arise with Science Education, \\nwhich has a self-reference rate (“same journal”) of 11 : 95; similar to IJSE at 13: 105. \\nIt could be germane, however, in the case of Journal of Research in Science Teaching \\n(JRST), with its ratio of 32 : 90. It is not completely accurate, of course, to generalize \\nfrom one issue, but it seems that the researchers who publish in the two American \\njournals include non -North American science education journals (such as IJSE, \\nStudies in Science Education, Research in Science Education, School Science \\nReview, Journal of Biofogical Education, etc.) among their readings in even less pro- \\nportion than they do Group 2 journals, which actually constitute a fair amount of the \\nreferences. \\nIt must be kept in mind that American scholars are leading the research in our field \\nand it is hardly surprising that in reviewing the literature on a particular issue, one \\nwill come across a high number of papers published in the U.S. (as reflected also in \\nthe origin of references from IJSE).

We are in good company, too. Harvard Educational \\nReview, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, and Teachers College Record \\nare among similarly ranked publications. The top rated publications are American \\nEducational Research Association (AERA) publications with Educational \\nResearcher consistently at the top. \\nWhat this ranking suggests is that SE articles are read and cited widely in sub- \\nsequent research publications. The high rankings suggest that the citations are in \\na variety of journals, not just science education journals. Two factors are reported \\nin the citation index. One is how many articles, on average, are referenced by \\nothers. Another is how long articles continue to be cited. Given our high ranking, \\nthe data suggest that our authors are having an impact on the growth of knowl- \\nedge in science education and education research. \\nThe exact index numbers and rankings for four representative years are: \\nYear Impact Factor Rank \\n~ \\n1993 0.917 11 of 90 \\n1992 1.118 7 of 90 \\n1991 0.784 15 of 90 \\n1990 0.9 19 12 of 93 \\nA QUALITY CULTURE OF REVIEWING \\nI am very pleased to report to our readership that the goals I have set for improving \\nthe quality of referee review of manuscripts have been attained. For the past two \\nyears the acceptance rate of the journal has been about 35% (i.e., 1 in 3 articles sub- \\nmitted are accepted). Together, the members of the editorial board and the reviewers \\nhave created a culture that results in the comprehensive and thorough reviewing of \\nScience Education 80( 1): 1-3 (1996) \\n0 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. CCC 0036-8326/96/01OOO1-03 2 DUSCHL \\nsubmitted research reports and scholarly manuscripts. As evidence of this, authors of- \\nten receive three page single-spaced reviews of their work. In turn, the process pro- \\nduces high quality articles. \\nA key component of nurturing this culture has been our practice of distributing \\neach referee’s blind review of a manuscript to the other reviewers, with the referees’ \\nnames, not the authors, attached. Through this process, our referees learn from each \\nother how to prepare more effective reviews, and I am able to better discern some \\npatterns of reviewing. \\nLet me share the positive trends that I see. The best reviews begin with a summary \\nof the article and a statement of the referee’s understanding of the author’s intended \\ngoals. Next, a paragraph that describes the referee’s area of expertise helps both the \\neditor and the author put the comments into context. This is then typically followed \\nby two sections, the first of which sets out the major areas of feedback. Examples of \\ncommon major area topics include 1) omission of relevant research or frameworks; \\n2) flaws in the design of the study or argument structure of a position; and 3) claims \\nand assertions not backed by evidence or by support from other reports of research. \\nThe second section focuses on such things are formatting of tables, writing style, \\nspelling, listing of relevant published manuscripts, and clarity of expression. \\nBased on the letters I receive, it appears that authors are very appreciative of the \\nefforts made by our board members and reviewers. More often than not, cover letters \\nof revised manuscripts we receive include a paragraph stating how helpful the re- \\nviews were in shaping the revising of the manuscript. Even authors who received re- \\njection decisions will sometimes write back expressing their appreciation for the high \\nquality of the reviews. I thus attribute the high frequency of resubmitted rejected arti- \\ncles to the work of our exemplary referees. \\nA PROCESS FOR APPEAL \\nThe system isn’t perfect, though. Occasionally we have delinquent referees and au- \\nthors may receive only two reviews (rather than the standard three). The hardest part \\nof my role as editor is determining the decision when the reviews are disparate (i.e., \\none accept and one reject). The task is made easier if, when reading the reviews, it is \\nclear to me that one of the referees has more expertise on the topic than the other. \\nThe task is also made easier when one of the referees picks up on a positive or nega- \\ntive aspect that the other doesn’t \\nAuthors should know, however, that there is an appeal process for manuscripts re- \\njected after review. If they feel that the decision by the editor is not consistent with \\nthe recommendations of the referees, then an appeal for a re-evaluation of the edi- \\ntor’s decision can be requested. \\nThe appeal process is straightforward. The rejected manuscript is sent to a member \\nof the Journal’s editorial board who is selected by the editor by matching her or his \\nexpertise with the focus of the article. All pertinent correspondence and information \\nis sent to the selected board member, including author’s names and the referee re- \\nviews, identified by name. The board member is asked to render a decision based on \\nher or his evaluation which the editor then follows. \\n 1098237x, 1996, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730800102 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

ROBERTS \\nThe University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N IN4, Canada; e-mail: \\nroberts@acs.ucalgary.ca \\nIn the past 15 years there has been a remarkable legitimation of the idea that quali- \\ntative research might have a place in science education. How things change. When I \\nwas a graduate student in the early 1960s, a story was floating around that a new sci- \\nence education journal was needed because it was difficult to publish quantitative re- \\nsearch reports in one of the most prominent science education journals of the time- \\nwhich was the forerunner to Science Education. According to the story, the Journal \\nof Research in Science Teaching (JRST) had to be created to provide quantitative re- \\nsearchers in science education with an alternative route to publication. It was said \\nthat there was a long-standing editorial bias to the effect that quantitative research \\nwas not welcome for publication in Science Education. \\nI do not know how true that story is, but I suspect there might be some readers who \\nhave had personal experience related to it. I do know that I, for one, had to search fairly \\ndiligently and persistently for alternatives to JRST for a couple of decades after it was \\nstarted in 1963, in order to publish science education research that was qualitative in \\nnature. In fact, I sat on the editorial board for JRST in a meeting about 10 years ago \\nwhen Russ Yeany asked us to debate what fraction of qualitative research manuscripts \\nin each issue might be acceptable to the readership. This was not altogether a question \\nof standards, although quality and rigor were issues in our discussion to be sure. No, it \\nwas more a matter of what science education researchers (and the broader community \\nof educational researchers, for that matter) would recognize as research at all. Since \\nthat time, a huge literature has emerged in educational research about that very issue. \\nAs well, a number of how-to-do-it books are available now that were not available \\nthen. Qualitative research seems to have won a niche even though there was significant \\ndoubt about that 15 years ago-and, indeed, I venture to say there still is.’ \\n‘1 was unable to attend the 1992 meeting of NARST in Boston, but I found it very interesting to read \\nthe “Comments and Criticism” section, and the “Editorial,” of the November 1992 issue of JRST. These \\nchronicle some discussion at the meeting that shows how the matter of an acceptable niche for qualita- \\ntive research in science education is still festering. \\nScience Education 80(3): 243-248 (1996) \\n0 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. CCC 0036-8326/96/030243-06 244 ROBERTS \\nBut a niche won is not necessarily a niche held, or a niche held without vigilance. \\nWhether qualitative research is recognized as research at all, as opposed say to parochial storytelling or incestuous opinion-swapping or unproductive navel-gazing, \\nis a complicated issue which has at least two intertwined parts: (a) the \\nquality of an \\nindividual piece of such research, which is very much a function of (b) the argumen- \\ntative structure of the research report itself. \\nAs a research community, we have struggled with the problem of how to recognize \\nsound, acceptable qualitative research so that standards of quality can be applied in the \\njudgment of manuscripts. There are two major pitfalls to which I would like to direct \\nattention and make some comments - and both are problems which I find occurring in- \\ncreasingly in manuscripts to be reviewed for possible publication, in dissertations sub \\nmitted to award committees, and indeed on occasion in published articles. The first is \\nthe temptation for a researcher to mistake a “case story” for a case study. The second, \\nnot unrelated problem, is the sense one gets from some qualitative research that the re- \\nport does not give us much depth, and that it is not very systematic. As a community of \\nresearchers, we need to be individually self-policing about the quality of our collective \\nknowledge base, and I hope that these comments are helpful toward that end. \\nRegarding the first point, I did not invent the felicitous term “case story,” although \\nI wish I had. The gist of its meaning in this context is that it is essentially a narrative \\npresentation of data, but one that lacks a point and does not make an argument. \\n“Look here at what these five teachers did in school X’ is not, repeat not, a case \\nstudy. It is not a research report either, because nothing has been made of the data. \\nOne is reminded of the 1966 Peanuts cartoon, which I have seen reproduced often to \\nremind science teachers that field trips have to have a pedagogical point. Linus re- \\nports to Charlie Brown that the class had been on a field trip: “It was a real field, and \\nwe saw it! We stood right there, and we saw that field!” Gee, folks. We have all seen \\nteachers at work in classrooms. So what is the point? The analog in a quantitative \\nstudy would be a data table; in that case, what reviewer would recommend the publi- \\ncation of a data table about which no point is made or conclusion drawn? \\nRegarding the second pitfall, the cluster that goes by the name “qualitative \\nmethodology” has a greater potential than the cluster we all call “quantitative \\nmethodology” (what stereotypes!) to offer a deeper understanding of the qualities of \\nevents and phenomena in science education, hence its name. It is an understanding of \\na different sort. Sometimes a meaningful take on science education events requires \\neither increasingly thick description or fresh conceptual frameworks, to allow for \\nclaims to be made about what-kind-of and how-appropriate, rather than how-many-of \\nor to-what-degree. However, getting a thicker description does not mean just adding \\nmore details willy-nilly. Surely it is noncontroversial to say that one’s observations \\nshould have a theoretical thrust behind them, a conceptual framework that guides what one is looking for. Part of the quality of a piece of qualitative research, then, \\nlies in the sophistication and appropriateness of the conceptual framework(s) brought \\nto bear in the study, together with discussion of what makes them salient to science \\neducation phenomena. The better the conceptual framework(s) and the discussion of \\nthem, the more likely the research report is to be satisfying on systematic grounds \\nand, therefore, provide the depth of understanding that qualitative research has to of- \\nfer as its special contribution to knowledge-building. \\n 1098237x, 1996, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730800302 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Both matters have been treated at length in an \\nearlier paper of mine which is, despite its appearance in 1982, I believe as valid to- \\nday as it was then.* That paper put qualitative studies on the same footing as quanti- \\ntative studies by looking at the basic structure of a knowledge-producing argument, \\nsuch as the argument pattern Stephen Toulmin develops in his classic work The Uses \\nof Arg~rnent.~ \\nWhen quality of knowledge building is at issue, it does not matter whether the \\nresearch is qualitative or quantitative. One reason it is easy to pass judgment on a \\nquantitative study is that we can lean on the time-tested methodological structure of \\nproblem, theoretical framework, hypothesis, data, results, discussion, and conclusion. \\nImplicit in every good qualitative study is the same basic structure, but often the \\npoint of such research is not so much to match a logical and methodological algo- \\nrithm as it is to seek new understanding. Let us explore this. \\nToulmin begins by reminding us that the logical move from data to conclusion has \\nto be warranted. Some canon for knowledge building, some warrant, has to authorize \\nthe step, just as a search warrant has to authorize a policeman’s step across the \\nthreshold of a private home. If we find that instances of antecedent and consequent \\nevents match an idealized form (e.g., correlation) in a way that fits a definition of sta- \\ntistical significance, we have warrants to conclude accordingly: the form and the defi- \\nnition. The instances provide the data; the conclusion about statistically significant \\ncorrelation follows readily. The argumentative structure is so well established that the \\nresearcher’s argument is virtually algorithmic. \\nIn qualitative research there is an exact parallel, but the warrants are not necessar- \\nily as familiar. A wide variety of fields of scholarship can be tapped for conceptual \\ncategories, distinctions, and relationships to provide warrants for conclusions based \\non investigating the qualities that inhere in science education events, encounters, in- \\ntentions, and so forth. I do not mean to suggest here that qualitative studies in science \\neducation are all “applied something-else”; educational studies have their own con- \\nceptual and ontological frameworks. But as human encounters, science education \\nevents of whatever kind are multifaceted, and explanations for them can and should \\ndraw heavily on a wide range of aspects of our intellectual heritage including, but not \\nlimited to, educational studies. \\nLying behind warrants, so to speak, is a different kind of knowledge-building en- \\ntity, which Toulmin calls backing. It is at this level, I argued in my 1982 paper, that \\nthe knowledge-building systems inherent in qualitative and quantitative research ap- \\nproaches can be found to differ profoundly. The ones associated with quantitative re- \\nsearch are built very much around metaphysical respect for the form and mechanism \\nof things and events, whereas the knowledge-building systems associated with quali- \\ntative research tend toward the situations and integrations which things and events \\n*Roberts, D.

Those four knowledge systems have been examined systemat- \\nically by Stephen Pepper, and his description of them is laid out in my paper.4 \\nSo when it comes to acceptability of qualitative research as research at all, we \\nhave to look beyond the rigor and structure of its arguments. Both qualitative and \\nquantitative approaches to research can be shown to be rigorous, and reports based \\non them can be appraised according to the quality of their argumentative structures. \\nWhat seems to cause researchers of different persuasions to take pot-shots at each \\nother is their loyalty to the metaphysics of quite different knowledge-building sys- \\ntems. Quantitative research approaches enable researchers to generate accounts that \\nlocate and explain events in terms of space, time, number, and determinism, and \\nPepper points out that the strength of such accounts is more on the side of precision \\nthan scope. Against that, qualitative research approaches allow for explanations based on the qualities of events, in terms of categories such as situation and integra- \\ntion or wholeness-stronger on the side of scope than precision. Throughout the in- \\ntellectual history of the Western world, these two broad approaches to knowledge \\nbuilding have coexisted. Their capacity to provide a “take” on events in science edu- \\ncation, or anything else, is complementary rather than competitive. It is around these \\nissues that we should listen carefully to pleas in the literature to respect the comple- \\nmentarity \\nof the two approaches, pleas for researchers to be tolerant of and try to un- \\nderstand one another’s metaphysical preoccupations. \\nBut look at the responsibility the different preoccupations require of the researcher \\nwhen it comes to rigor and quality. A preoccupation with precision means a faithful \\nadherence to well-established canons of inquiry. Judging manuscripts for publication \\nentails appraising an instance of a relatively familiar methodology, familiar espe- \\ncially for science education researchers who are steeped in the investigative tradi- \\ntions of the natural sciences. The conclusions which such studies can make are \\ndefined by the formal points of the methodology: “this correlation is significant be- \\nyond the influence of chance”; “that set of means is significantly different on the ba- \\nsis of ANOVA”; “the experimental group significantly outperformed the control \\ngroup,” etc. The conclusions to be made by qualitative studies, however, are more \\nvaried and tend to be more of the type “We can understand this situation better now, \\nbecause we have a systematic account of the qualities of the events.” \\nThe difference is not trivial. A research community devoted to making practice \\nmore intelligible, as we are, is a community ultimately in search of explanations. In \\nthe two broadly different knowledge-building systems mentioned above, there is a \\ndifferent concept of when it is that one has an explanation. N. R. Hanson conceptual- \\nized the difference in the context of the natural sciences, and notice (below) that he \\nargues for taking the best from two extreme views. The one he calls “formalism,” and \\nthe other “sensationalism” (or “formless empiricism,” stressing an overreliance on \\nfamiliarity with phenomena-not sensational in the sense of “spectacular”). He uses \\nthe account by Hempel and Oppenheim as the epitome of a formalist’s concept of \\n4Pepper, S. C. (1942). World hypotheses: A study in evidence.

It suggests that an explaining of x is not a rubbing of one’s nose into x \\nor an attempt to empathize with the “pure essence” of x. Rather it is an inferential- \\nlinking of x with a variety of other non-problematic data, or data-claims. . . . \\nNow, what empirical counterposture is to be adopted in contrast . . . ? Perhaps it \\nis this: there is no substitute for old-fashioned familiarity when one seeks to under- \\nstand a subject matter. Truly, there is little to be explained (at least about fish) to the \\nold fisherman who . . . has lived all his life with net and hook, gaff and oar. What \\n. . . will the twenty-year-old ichthyologist explain to him? . . . Deep and abiding \\nfamiliarity with a subject matter can render it totally understood, unproblematic and comprehensible-sometimes in the face of a total lack of theoretical \\nor inferential \\nsophistication. (p. 43) \\nHaving sketched the extremes, though, Hanson next points out a weakness in the for- \\nmalist position-to wit, “explanation (in Hempel’s sense) may be possible without \\nunderstanding”-and, in the experience-based but unarticulated sensationalist posi- \\ntion, “Our . . . fisherman . . , could not explain (to others) . . . seasonal spawn- \\ning” (p. 44). Wanting the best of the extremes, Hanson asks: \\nWhat can be wrong with our seeking examples of scientific theory which are capable \\nboth of explaining u la Hempel and of providing understanding and illumination of \\nthe nature of the phenomena in question? Even if distinguishable, the two are gen- \\nuinely worthwhile objectives for scientific enquiry; they are wholly compatible. And, \\nit may be noted, the second is unattainable without the first. So although Hempel’s \\naccount of explanation may not be sufficient, it seems to be necessary. Ontological \\ninsight, unstructured by precise argument and analysis, is mere speculation at best, \\nand navel-contemplatory twaddle at worst. (p. 45) \\nThe use of extremes is a rhetorical device, of course. The practitioner’s tacit \\nknowledge is portrayed as lacking a system and the formalist’s abstraction as lacking \\nsubstance. Hanson’s struggle over conceptions of what an explanation “really is” in \\nscience reflects the substantial turmoil experienced by the philosophy of science in \\nthe middle of this century. The Hempel-Oppenheim account, focusing as it does on \\nthe logical form of an explanation, was judged to be too narrow an account. A num- \\nber of philosophers, Toulmin among them, argued for an account of an explanation \\nwhich included attention to substance as well as form, to the understanding that an \\n5Hanson, N. R.

For instance, Shapere noted in 1965 that “there is a type of explanation, \\nin terms of ‘models,’ that, while common in the sciences, does not meet the \\nHempelian specification.”6 See-sawing back and forth between form and substance to \\nget an adequate account of what scientists were reporting as their explanations is a \\nstriking feature of philosophy of science at that time. I would submit that knowledge \\nbuilding in science education is going through similar evolutionary turmoil just now. \\nLet me return, then, to a few comments about the two major pitfalls that seem to \\ncharacterize unsatisfactory qualitative research reports. The first problem, involving \\nthe presentation of a “case story” without a point or conclusion, results in a report \\nwhich exhibits such a serious flaw in argumentative structure that it does not consti- \\ntute an argument at all. That a conclusion is missing is lethal. There is no contribu- \\ntion to knowledge, hence there is nothing to be gained by taking up journal space. \\nThe second pitfall, namely insufficient utilization, presentation, and/or discussion of \\nappropriate conceptual frameworks, is a failure at another level of Toulmin’s argu- \\nmentative structure: the character and substance of the warrants on which the conclu- \\nsions are based. It is as if in Hanson’s account the experienced practitioner fails to \\nsurface the warrants that give systematic coherence to what is known, so that the \\nconclusions float free of their underpinnings. Once again, such reports do not ad- \\nvance knowledge building and do not deserve journal space. \\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that some points about the enterprise of science edu- \\ncation research are self-evident. As a research community, we are devoted to making \\nit possible for practitioners, including ourselves, to “improve” science education by \\nunderstanding and explaining its events and phenomena better, more deeply, and \\nmore systematically. It follows that whatever approaches to research are used, the \\npoint of doing research is the same. Qualitative research, the upstart, is still on the \\ndefensive, in my view. Qualitative research reports that either have no point/conclu- \\nsion, or shortchange the reader at the level of the substance and upshot of conceptual \\nframeworks and warrants, threaten the very fragile niche that sound qualitative re- \\nsearch has established. Lack of rigor and quality can only feed the impression that \\nthe approach itself is not research at all. The more instances the research community \\nsees, the stronger the impression. What a pity. \\n‘In the Introduction to his Philosophical Problems of Natural Science (Macmillan, 1965), Dudley \\nShapere lays out this and a number of other midcentury dilemmas in the philosophy of science, followed \\nby selected essays which either shed some light on the dilemmas or have contributed to them. The cita- \\ntion here is from page 25, in a section where Shapere is discussing “the widespread application of math- \\nematical logic to problems of the philosophy of science.” \\n 1098237x, 1996, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730800302 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The meeting brought together a remarkable group \\nof science educators from up and down and across the continent of Africa. The orga- \\nnizers also invited a few “friends of the continent,” among whom I had the honor \\nof being included. The truly distinguished friends, however, were Philip Morrison of \\nMIT, Eleanor Duckworth of Harvard, and Jerry Pines of the California Institute of \\nTechnology. But the conference was not about the friends. It was a conference by and \\nfor Africans, and among African science educators the conference was something of \\na “coming out” event for post-apartheid South Africa. I mention these things because \\nI have learned much from my association with African educators, and one lesson this \\npast December in South Africa bears on the purpose of this editorial. \\nThis editorial originated with the 1995 annual meeting of the Science Education \\nBoard where a question arose concerning the name of the international section, In- \\nternational Science Education. It was suggested there that the name was no longer \\nappropriate and, after some discussion in the board meeting, members decided to \\npursue further discussion by e-mail. As the editor for the International Science Edu- \\ncation section, I was asked to prepare a short document on the “re-naming’’ issue and \\nto initiate the e-mail dialogue with board members and contributing editors. That dia- \\nlogue concluded with the consensus that a name change was in order. The Interna- \\ntional Science Education section was to be renamed the section for Culture and \\nComparative Studies. A short while later in South Africa, my experiences there sug- \\ngested the form in which to best present the section name change and rationale to the \\nreadership of Science Education. \\nIn apartheid-era South Africa only whites were allowed to call themselves, “South \\nAfrican” with no preceding modifier. Not only were people of color in apartheid-era \\nSouth Africa physically segregated; they were also verbally segregated as “Black South \\nAfrican,” “Colored South African,” or “Asian South African.” I gained some insight into \\nthe significance of this verbal form of apartheid through a story told to me by an “Asian \\nSouth African” physician. She had only recently been stopped for a minor traffic viola- \\ntion and the traffic officer asked what was for him a routine question, “What are you?” \\nFrom his visual inspection of the driver, the answer he surely expected was either “Col- \\nored’ or “Asian” South African. As the physician recounted the story I could see emo- \\ntion in her eyes as she recalled the revelatory moment she realized she could answer \\nScience Education 80(5): 489-491 (1996) \\n0 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

This story and its lesson \\non the significance of a name reminded me of an incident I experienced at the 1995 Na- \\ntional Association for Research in Science Teaching meeting, which has less emotional \\ncontent and less significance than my South African story. Nevertheless, I was con- \\nfronted by a science educator who is not North American and who wanted to know why \\nScience Education segregated non-North American authors from North American au- \\nthors. The educator was referring to the International Science Education section know- \\ning that I was the section editor. “After all, don’t North Americans consider themselves \\npart of the international community of science educators?” \\nThe question caught my attention. Clearly what we call a person or thing-what \\nnames we choose to communicate with-can have significant emotional impact and \\nconsequences for people. For my physician friend, a change of name brought great \\nemotional joy. For my “international” colleague, a section named “International” was \\na defacto dis-invitation to participate in the journal Science Education. The power of \\na name is not something customarily recognized by many Westerners. “What’s in a \\nname?” Shakespeare asked. “A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.” More \\nrecently and much less poetically, Feynman noted, similarly, that to know the name \\nof something is not to know very much. This casual view of names, however, is a cul- \\nturally rooted sentiment of the West. I recall that, while I was living in Nigeria, my \\nstudents did not speak each others’ names in the casual fashion to which I was accus- \\ntomed. I learned that in some Nigerian groups mothers never call the first-born son \\nby name. The point of these musings is simply that in a culturally plural world, \\nnames do matter. Despite the West’s more casual attitude, names are an important as- \\npect of communication. \\nIt is not the case that Science Education has been insensitive to people beyond \\nNorth American borders. The very existence of the International section bears wit- \\nness to a long-standing interest in the global nature of science education. The journal \\nhas been understandably ethnocentric. After all, it began in the USA many years ago \\nwhen communication across the country was slow and sometimes difficult let alone \\ncommunication abroad. Today, though, we live in a very different world where the \\nconcept of a “global village” is a reality, not just a media sound bite. It is a reality \\nmade possible by the astounding developments in information and communications \\ntechnology. This sophisticated technology has made it possible for this journal to \\nhave contributing editors literally at the far reaches of the globe. Indeed, the practices \\nof the journal in recent years have been notably international. In addition to the in- \\nternational group of scholars who are the contributing editors, the list of manuscript \\nreviewers is international, and of course the journal itself has for years published arti- \\ncles originating from many different countries. Thus the section name change simply \\nrepresents more clearly the journal’s actual practice and true constituency. Moreover, \\nthe new name more accurately represents the 1994 editorial policy for this section \\nwhich states inter alia: \\nThis section serves as a forum for the critical discussion of cultural, sociological, and \\npolitical influences on all aspects of science education. Its purpose is to bring a \\ncross-cultural and international perspective to science education that will broaden \\n 1098237x, 1996, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.3730800502 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

(Cobern, 1994, p. 217) \\nLet me retum now to ASTE ’95 for a closing example of the type of stimulating \\ncommunication that I trust will appear through the articles published in this section. \\nA plenary speaker at ASTE ’95 addressed the problem of large class size in sec- \\nondary science education. During the discussion a notable US scientist commented \\nthat US universities face this same problem of very large classes and he offered some \\nattractive ideas on effective instruction with large classes that are being used at his \\nuniversity. The participants’ response was less than enthusiastic perhaps because the \\nsolution seemed too simple. Indeed, Magnus Cole, a senior statesman of African sci- \\nence education, rose to ask, “Is your problem really the same as ours? Is the problem \\nin African schools large classes or over-crowded classes?” Clearly the scientist saw \\nthe problem solely on the level of too few teachers with too many students. Professor \\nCole correctly pointed out that the scientist could hold his view only because he had \\naccess to considerable resources, e.g., large lecture halls, modem media and audio \\nequipment, teaching assistants, etc. To say that the problem is instead over-crowding \\nis to say that the available resources are over crowded. If an African educator were to \\nsubmit a comparative article (say) on the problem of large science classes in Africa \\nand North America, I would expect such an article to cause a North American reader \\nto re-think the definition of “large class” based on the distinction between large \\nclasses and over-crowded classes. It would be no small gain if this produced a more \\nhumble approach to cross-cultural problem solving or even cross-institutional prob- \\nlem solving within a culture (e.g., from university to school). Thus, I view this sec- \\ntion as a multilateral forum for the sharing of information that leads to a deeper \\nunderstanding of how problems and issues can be defined and an increased awareness \\nof the importance of cultural context in science education. With these thoughts in \\nmind it is my pleasure to introduce the Science Education section for Culture and \\nComparative Studies. \\nWILLIAM W.

School children, for one, are exposed tomany scientiﬁc concepts and ideas during family visits to museums, zoos, and science centers,and while participating in science activities sponsored by community-based organizations such asyouth groups, community centers, and camps. Children, as well as adults, spend time at homereading science-related magazines and watching science-related television. Many educational fa-cilities such as botanical gardens and natural history museums are staffed by adult volunteers whoenjoy learning science and sharing their enthusiasm for it with others. Communities and individu-als value these kinds of experiences,supporting them through their interest and patronage.\\nThis type of learning experience is often referred to as “informal.” Rather than deﬁning it,\\nas it often is, as learning that happens out-of-school, we prefer to deﬁne it by its characteris-tics. Informal learning refers to activities that are nonsequential, self-pacing, nonassessed, andoften involving groups. Some examples of research being conducted in this growing area ofscience education are featured in this special issue of \\nScience Education.\\nInitially, we were not sure what response to the call for papers we could expect from the in-\\nformal science education community. The response was impressive: we received 40 manu-scripts from four different countries. Researchers are investigating a wide variety of scienceexperiences in homes and communities.\\nInterestingly, while all of the submissions told compelling stories, the research designs\\nwere often less compelling theoretically and methodologically. Our impression was that manyof the submitting authors were unaware of relevant social science research in related areassuch as cognitive and social psychology, linguistics and anthropology, public understandingof science research, and even science education. Awareness of research models from differenttraditions could provide a theoretical underpinning for the “informal” science learning re-search and reduce the need for recreating methodologies. The articles included in this issuewere chosen in part because they demonstrated such an awareness. \\nA general problem, irrespective of particular submissions, is simply the methodological\\nchallenge of measuring effects in environments where participants attend voluntarily and en-gage in a wide variety of activities. Some researchers are ready to look for speciﬁc outcomes,for example, investigating recall of speciﬁc museum exhibition content. Others do more de-scriptive research attempting to capture unpredicted effects, such as ethnographic studies ofafter-school science clubs. Because of these methodological challenges, it is important to havegood communication between theory and practice.\\nThe applied side of the ﬁeld borrows from traditions of museum development, program\\nevaluation, and media research. As a result, researchers investigating exhibits and program-ming tend to focus more on design issues rather than much of the work in formal sciencelearning. Within this focus, researchers examine affective outcomes, from which formal sci-ence educators can learn. Our selection of articles represents a variety of starting points, rang-ing from the applied to the more theoretical research.\\nIn hindsight, it is not surprising that there would be such variety among the submissions.\\nScience Education 81(6):629–631 (1997)\\n©1997 John Wiley &Sons,Inc. CCC 0036-8326/97/060629-03The dialogue between curricular science educa tors,researchers,and informal educa tors is in\\nits infancy. We are pleased to think tha t this issue is par t of the widening tr end toward cross-\\nfertilization of ﬁelds and pr actices. In making our selections f or this issue ,11 in total, we have\\nmade every effort to choose articles reﬂective of the di versity in the inf ormal science domain.\\nThree articles reminds us of the man y contacts adults and c hildren have with science im -\\nages and ideas in their e veryday lives. In one of these ,Steve Alsop and Mik e Watts evaluate\\nadults’understandings of a science topic as a r esult of a pub lic health campaign.

This program tries to provide alter native career models f or\\nhigh school students thr ough visits to w orking agricultural laboratories in rural areas. Such in-\\nterventions ar e important to stud y because car eer modeling is v ery much needed. Also of in -\\nterest is the pr ogram’s unusual approach that is tailored to students’ needs.\\nThe majority of the w ork in informal science lear ning is being conducted in m useums and sci -\\nence center s. Eight of the ar ticles we selected w ere conducted in them and e xplore some of the\\nunique aspects of lear ning and design in those settings. There is a long histor y of such studies in\\nmuseum work investigating the pr esentation of subject ma tter,visitor responses, and the design of\\napparati that facilitate the emer gence of a conce pt. Four of the studies accor dingly examine fea-\\ntures of exhibitions in science center s and one e xamines the use of humor in a planetar ium. They\\ndo so,however,from very different perspectives. The articles by John H. Falk and Cod y Sandifer\\nboth look a t sets of exhibits tha t are grouped to con vey particular conce pts. Falk studies ho w pre-\\nsentation elements in an e xhibition af fected visitor s’understanding of the major messa ges. \\nSandifer studies the time dif ferent visitor g roups spend a t exhibits. They illustrate the difﬁculties\\nin assessing w hat people actuall y learn in the casual en vironment of a science center . In another\\nkind of pr esentation study,Martin S.

She shows that hands-on pr ocessing and e ven some f orms of inquir y are not nec-\\nessarily enough. Reed Ste vens and Ro gers Hall are interested in ho w visitors make,use,and\\nrestructure representations of scientiﬁ c phenomenon. Using video to suppor t reﬂective think-\\ning,they show how a technological tool can help visitor s distinguish betw een how a phenome -\\nnon works (a tornado) and ho w a model of the phenomenon w orks (a tornado simulation).\\nTwo studies e xamine sc hool ﬁeld trip experiences,something tha t every school distr ict as-\\nsumes is w orthwhile although, perhaps,not clearly why.

Bloom, Section Editors\\nAn Editorial Introduction\\nand Invitation\\nThis issue of Science Education introduces the new section, “The Books,” which signals the\\njournal’s interest in ﬁlling a need felt by its readership. Over the years, the Editorial Board hasbecome concerned that the international ﬁeld of science education has not been well servedby the relatively scant attention paid to books by journals and other periodical publications.Although secondary sources and various library tools enable consumers to identify journal ar-ticles and conference papers when the latter are submitted to information data bases likeERIC, readers are not well supported in their efforts to locate information published in booksand monographs of similar size: few journals in the ﬁeld carry traditional book review sec-tions, no journal offers lists of published books received, and there is no place for Institutesand Centers to publicize their informal monographs.\\nThe two parts of “The Books” in Science Education will provide consumers with a valuable\\ntool for accessing these materials in two ways. The ﬁrst portion, “The Reviews,” will consistof critical accounts of books selected by the editors from those submitted by publishers. Thesecond portion, “Books Received,” will list books received from commercial publishers andmonographs received from research and development centers and institutes in universities andsimilar institutions. Each entry will be accompanied by an annotation of one or two sentences.\\nAlthough we do not wish to follow criteria slavishly, the following will guide our decisions\\nto review or to list books we receive:\\n1. Books describing recent research and developments in science education and related\\nﬁelds will be reviewed or listed.\\n2. Textbooks for science teacher education, as well as textbooks for general teacher edu-\\ncation and graduate study in education, will be reviewed or listed if the editors judgethem as offering novel or signiﬁcant research-based perspectives.\\n3. Academic texts of general appeal to the science education community at universities\\nand colleges, as well as some tertiary level textbooks that the editors judge useful tosecondary school teachers, will be reviewed or listed. It is not anticipated that K-12 sci-ence textbooks will be reviewed or listed.\\n4. Books that speak to science in nonscientiﬁc ways and books that have promise for\\nshowing the relationship of science to other ﬁelds will be listed.\\n5.

At the graduate level,the varieties of con -\\nstructivist perspectives revealed in the c hapters could pr ovide a basis f or a more advanced dis -\\ncussion of the na ture,assumptions, and components of constr uctivist perspectives,and of the\\nrelationship betw een philosophical per spectives,teaching and lear ning processes,and class-\\nroom environments.\\nThere are ﬁve chapters that could be ca tegorized as primarily philosophical or theor etical.\\nThese include an intr oduction b y the editor s and David Hawkins (who concisel y outlines the\\nhistorical under pinnings of constr uctivism); a c hapter on the g enerative approach to science\\nteaching by Merlin Wittrock that describes a highl y useful and theor etically well-founded\\nmodel; a c hapter by Richard Gunstone tha t details impor tant connections betw een constr uc-\\ntivism,conceptual change,and metaco gnition; a c hapter by Malcolm Car r and other s on the\\nnature of the constr uctivist paradigm,which nicely dovetails with Wittrock’s chapter; and the\\nvolume’s ﬁnal chapter,by Richard White,which sketches a sorely needed theor y of content.\\nThese chapters are creative and thought-pr ovoking discussions, and represent fascinating \\nexplorations which go beyond many of the cur rent issues in constr uctivist perspectives. They\\nprovide good accounts of constr uctivism and suc h topics as theor ies of lear ning and memor y,\\nmotivation,the nature of conce ptual change,enhancing students’ metacognitive skills,and \\nthe relationships betw een metaco gnition and conce ptual change—a truly rich area for \\nresearch.\\nThe four chapters describing science instr uctional units ar e by classroom teachers,assisted\\nby Kate Brass.

Duit and Haeussler pr ovide intriguing arguments to\\nreject the notion tha t conceptual change is not the simplistic r eplacement of wr ong ideas with\\ncorrect ones.

Susan \\nLindee,1995. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York. ISBN 0-7167-2595-9.\\nWhen I teac h genetics,I ﬁnd it useful (if not imper ative) to provide conte xts for students to\\nthink about the meaning and br oader application of what they are learning. So,we might tur n\\nto current news and scientiﬁ c reports to explore the “latest developments” in the ﬁeld,to as-\\nsess how these de velopments ar e reported,and to gauge their potential implica tions for indi-\\nviduals and society . As I read The DNA Mystique ,I often thought ho w useful this book w ould\\nbe to me as a biolo gy/genetics instr uctor. It is a thor oughly researched and skillfull y written\\naccount of ho w DNA and the “gene”have come to be vie wed in popular cultur e. This book\\nnot only furnishes numerous conte xts within w hich students might utiliz e what they are learn-\\ning but,more importantly,it provides a per spective necessar y for a complete under standing of\\ngenetics. No science e xists in a v acuum and thus no science should be taught as if it does.\\nThis is particularly true of moder n genetics,both because it inher ently concerns issues of per -\\nsonal identity ,health and disease ,behavior,and relatedness among li ving things past and \\npresent,and because it is so pr esent in popular cultur e—from the announcement of the iden -\\ntiﬁcation of impor tant genes via pr ess releases to “mutant”cartoon characters.\\nDorothy Nelkin and M. Susan Lindee w ere “repeatedly struck by the powers ascribed to the\\ngene in American cultur e”(p. vii) and their w ork on the book w as guided b y the following\\nquestions:\\nIf the newly ascribed powers of the g ene were taken seriously by consumer s,would it sha pe\\ntheir reactions to the institutional and political uses of g enetic inf ormation?...What ex-\\nactly [does] the g ene seem to be ca pable of doing in the te xts and ima ges of popular cultur e?\\nWhat powers [does] it possess? What problems [does] it seem to r esolve? (p. vii)\\nTo answer these,the author s pulled to gether the r esults of an e xtensive survey of the man y\\nmodes and sour ces through which modern genetics is con veyed to the pub lic,and of the kinds\\nof messa ges about DNA,genes,and heredity that are conveyed. And the author s have \\nanswered admirably. They provide useful histor ical background on g enetics and eug enics,as\\nwell as carefully documented descr iptions of ho w issues ar e dealt with in popular cultur e and\\nare related to social polic y. Illustrations are drawn from the genetic bases of beha vior,familial\\nrelationships, and disease sta tes.\\nThe two aspects of this book tha t I most appreciated are related to these car efully documented\\ndescriptions. First,the book contains 60 pa ges of endnotes inde xed to speciﬁ c claims made or\\nstories told thr oughout. Any reader,teacher or student, could easil y use these notes to c heck on\\nthe author s’presentation of the ma terial or to be gin research on a mor e focused topic . Second,for\\nthe most par t,the author s saved sharing their opinions a bout the ma terial they were presenting\\nuntil the ﬁ nal chapter of the book. While their c hoice of w hat to describe and ho w to descr ibe it\\nmust have been inﬂ uenced by their opinions, their descr iptive as opposed to cr itical presentation\\nallows the reader to tak e in and thoughtfull y consider the ma terial before being told ho w the au-\\nthors interpret its meaning . This aspect of the book mak es it particularly useful f or genetics in-\\nstruction:the book r aises issues on w hich opinions ma y vary,and it provides enough inf ormation\\nto stimulate discussion and de bate without pr oviding the “right”or “sanctioned” answer.\\nWith few exceptions I found the ma terial presented in the book to be biolo gically accurate.\\nYet I found their use of one conce pt to be pr oblematic. On several occasions, indirect refer-\\nences are made to the conce pt of heritability where the deﬁ nition of her itability seems to \\nbe misconstr ued.

This statement ma y imply,\\nincorrectly,that the Minnesota Center is c laiming tha t some per centage of trait X in an indi-\\nvidualis determined by genetic,as opposed to en vironmental, factors. What these per centage\\nestimates actuall y represent are heritability values:statistical measur es of the per centage of\\nthe phenotypic v ariation existing in a populationof individuals for the trait in question tha t\\ncan be accounted f or by genetic factors. (Note:The trait in question is typicall y a quantita tive\\ntrait,one that displays continuous phenotypic v ariation in the popula tion indica ting that it is\\ndetermined by multiple genes as w ell as environmental f actors.)\\nThis is an e xtremely important distinction because ther e are two constraints inher ent in the\\ndeﬁnition of her itability. The ﬁrst constraint is tha t a particular her itability value is valid only\\nwith respect to the speciﬁ c population from which it was derived. That is,given identical\\nstarting popula tions placed under dif ferent sets of en vironmental conditions, heritability val-\\nues can,and likely will,vary for the two populations for a given trait. The second constr aint is\\nthat a particular her itability value is not an estima te of any individual’s genetic limita tion or\\npotential, even though the media and sometimes the scientists themselv es might mak e it\\nsound this w ay. Both constr aints are crucial to the stance e xplicated in the ﬁ nal chapter on\\nmaterial presented thr oughout the book. Confusion ar ound the meaning and a pplicability of\\nheritability is common among indi viduals with quite sophistica ted under standings of other ar -\\neas of genetics as w ell as among students. That the author s’deﬁnition of her itability is a t best\\nunclear could be tur ned to an ad vantage in teaching:students could be ask ed to consider the\\naccuracy of the author s’statement and to distinguish betw een correct and ﬂ awed deﬁnitions.\\nFrom a general instructional per spective,I would certainly recommend tha t anyone teach-\\ning genetics at any level read this book, if only to more fully comprehend the di versity of\\nsources of and messa ges about genetics in popular cultur e. Further,I would urge that the\\nkinds of issues dealt with in this book be incor porated into instr uction,both to pr ovide stu-\\ndents with f orums for issue-based discussions and to incr ease student a wareness of the\\nbreadth of g enetics. I w ould not hesita te to recommend the book as supplemental r eading for\\nhigh-school and colle ge students, and I would encour age their teac hers to use speciﬁ c sections\\nor chapters as the basis f or classroom activities.\\nANNKINDFIELD\\nBiology Department\\nMallory Hall\\nMontclair State University\\nUpper Montc lair,NJ 07043, USA\\nGenes and Human Self-Kno wledge:Historical and Philosophical Reﬂ ections on Moder n\\nGenetics, edited by Robert F.

The theme of g enes and human self-kno wledge was timely because suppor ters of\\nthe Human Genome Pr oject (HGP) ha ve touted its a bility to teac h us “what it means to be hu -\\nman”through the ma pping of some 100,000 g enes and the sequencing of a pproximately 3 bil-\\nlion nucleotide base-pair s of the g enome. These 24 essa ys make a signiﬁ cant initial ste p\\ntoward examining this c laim and will inter est anyone concer ned about the impact g enetic\\nknowledge may have on our conce ptions of our selves,as individuals and ,more generally,as\\nhuman beings.\\nThe book is or ganized around three themes: (i) genetic identity and self-kno wledge; (ii) the\\npossible uses and a buses of g enetic kno wledge; and (iii) g enders,races,and futur e genera-\\ntions. Eac h of these sections opens with thr ee or four of the major pa pers delivered at the con-\\nference and c loses with the shor ter responses of panelist par ticipants. Rober t F. Weir’s preface\\nprovides a good introduction to the book. It descr ibes the na ture and pur pose of the conf er-\\nence,outlines the g oals and potential beneﬁ ts of the HGP ,poses the questions ad dressed by\\nthe conference papers,and summar izes the contr ibutions tha t make up each of the thr ee sec-\\ntions. Weir is perha ps misleading in one par t where he states that the HGP ,despite its fr equent\\nreferences to “thehuman genome,”does not seek to esta blish a “model”or “ideal”genome\\nbut is largely focused on “variations from genetic nor malcy.”It bears mention, ﬁrst,that “vari-\\nation from normalcy”presumes reference to some ideal or nor mative standard such as the or -\\nganism’s function or en vironment,and,second,that this is not the notion of v ariation that\\nevolutionary biologists fault the HGP f or ignoring.\\nSection 1’ s major contr ibutions are Kimber ley A. Quaid’ s “A Few Words from a ‘Wise’\\nWoman,”Dan W.

Quaid reports the results of a stud y that asked individuals at risk for Hunt-\\nington disease to shar e their thoughts and f eelings about their a t-risk status and about the im -\\npact of genetic testing . By including length y excerpts from respondents, Quaid succeeds in\\nopening a windo w onto the suf fering and cour age associated with Huntington’ s,while at the\\nsame time dr awing attention to the special na ture of genetic inf ormation and pr edictive test-\\ning. Brock and Ruse e xamine the implica tions that developments in molecular g enetics ar e\\nlikely to have on our vie ws of mor al agency. Brock notes tha t the long-standing philosophical\\ndebate between freedom and deter minism suppor ts a tension betw een social and le gal as-\\nsumptions of per sons as mor ally responsible agents and the scientiﬁ c approach to seek r educ-\\ntionistic e xplanations for human beha vior. While Ruse ar gues that geneticists’ commitments\\nto ontolo gical and methodolo gical reductionism pr esuppose deter minism and pr eclude the\\npossibility of fr ee will,Brock’s analysis that HGP ﬁndings will not c hange the nature of this\\ntheoretical problem seems cor rect,because en vironmental f actors are no more under an indi -\\nvidual’s control than g enetic factors.

He argues that the media, despite their per vasive inﬂuence on pub lic perceptions of\\nscience,cannot function as educa tor. Writing from a bac kground of in volvement in high\\nschool biolo gy curriculum design, McInerney’s contribution is both pr actical and illumina t-\\ning. He consider s how to translate three aspects of la boratory science: information; technol-\\nogy; and the na ture of science . Concerning information,it is impor tant to str ess conce pts,not\\nfacts. Similar ly,technologies need not be lear ned in detail, but understood in ter ms of their\\nbeneﬁts and limita tions. Teachers should emphasiz e how the explanations of science r epresent\\na distinct w ay of knowing about the w orld. McInerney also draws attention to v arious avail-\\nable resource materials which facilitate students’ involvement in the actual doing of science\\nand their eng agement with r elevant bioethical issues.\\nSection 3 inc ludes Ruth Hub bard’s “Constructs of Genetic Dif ference:Race and Se x,”\\nDavid L.

He mana ges this far too easil y,however,by focusing on r elatively weak opposing\\narguments suc h as the potential a buse of germ-line manipula tion by “tyrants”and “small\\ngroups of experts”and ignor ing stronger arguments: for example,whether tec hniques suc h as\\ngenetic scr eening combined with selecti ve abortion or embr yo selection in in vitrofertiliza-\\ntion accomplish the same ends as g erm-line manipula tion with less tec hnological intervention.\\nHubbard’s paper examines ho w biological explanations for race,sex,and gender differences\\nhave often been ideolo gically constructed to fur nish scientiﬁ c justiﬁcation for oppressive\\npower structures. She ar gues that,due to interbr eeding,the conce pt of race has no biolo gical\\nmeaning and tha t,although ther e are reproductive differences betw een the se xes,cultural be-\\nliefs in se x binarism have served to exaggerate them,ignoring the variation that is as large or\\nlarger within eac h of the tw o groups.

Hence,the HGP will contr ibute little to an e volutionary understanding of the human\\nspecies.\\nThe phrase “human self-kno wledge”embodies a g reat deal of philosophical histor y and com -\\nplexity. What it is to kno w ourselves as humans de pends on w ho we take “ourselves”to be—\\nwhether indi vidual minds and bodies, persons who are moral agents and member s of societies,\\nor biological representatives of homo sapiens.This antholo gy addresses all these di verse aspects\\nof human self-kno wledge. Although fundamental meta physical and e pistemolo gical questions\\nconcerning the na ture of selfhood and the possibility of self-kno wledge are engaged to a lesser\\nextent,there are several notable contributions. Since Descar tes,the self has alter nately been\\nconstrued as substanti ve,relational,logical,and a “convenient ﬁction.”Contempor ary philoso-\\nphy asks also w hether the self is r eal or constr ucted,isolated or sociall y embedded,and if ther e\\nis a “true”or authentic self tha t can be disco vered or about which one can be decei ved. The pos-\\nsibility of self-kno wledge rests not onl y on the na ture of the self ,but also on w hat is to count as\\nknowledge. Must we accept only what is objecti ve,scientiﬁc,and theoretically abstract,or can\\nwe also embr ace subjecti ve claims based in concr ete experience? To these ends, Quaid dis -\\ncusses the par ticular impact g enetic information has on self-identity and self-under standing due\\nto the prevalent tendenc y to regard the genome as some dee p and fundamental r epresentation of\\nthe individual. Within the conte xt of genetic screening,Quaid and Ca tes explore the relationship\\nbetween genetic inf ormation and self-kno wledge and Quaid and Thomson ar gue for the epis-\\ntemic value of subjecti ve experience in deter mining the meaning of par ticular genetic condi -\\ntions. Brock draws attention to the lik elihood tha t science’ s ability to manipula te the genome\\nwill move us from essentialist or substanti ve conceptions of selfhood to a vie w of the self as a\\n“mere bearer of predicates.”\\nThese points hint a t ways in which the discussion concer ning genes and human self-kno wl-\\nedge can be e xtended e ven further. Molecular biolo gy’s technological ability to manipula te\\nthe human g enome br ings society into something of an e xistentialist pr edicament. Science has\\ntended to concei ve human essence as a ﬁ xed object disco verable in nature. But,a human\\nessence embed ded in a manipula ble genome is not imm utable—it is created,not discovered.\\nThere is a very real sense in w hich in making the dif ﬁcult choices we face—for example,\\nthose involved in prenatal genetic scr eening and g erm-line manipula tion—we really are\\nchoosing our selves. How we choose is lik ely to reﬂect the dominant cultur al values which\\nshape our under standings of nor mality and disease . It will also be a function of the pr ivilege\\nwe accord to scientiﬁ c accounts of human self-kno wledge,and the extent to w hich we locate\\nhuman essence in str ands of DN A. At this junctur e,it is critical to recognize that culture fur-\\nnishes the conte xt within w hich science is car ried out,scientiﬁc results are interpreted,and\\ntechnologies are put to use . Although science educa tion is impor tant,as McIner ney suggests,\\nso also is the br oadest possib le examination of ho w scientiﬁ c and technological advances in\\nhuman molecular g enetics embod y various cultur al assumptions and fur ther particular social\\ninterests.

The new curriculum demanded mor e sophistica ted information about both con -\\ntent knowledge and processes,and it required more complete kno wledge of ways to integrate\\nboth in under standing and teac hing science . In the 1990s, the shift w as toward science “based\\non enquir y,investigation,and knowledge and under standing” (Russell et al., p. 80),one\\nchange alluded to in the te xt’s subtitle. It is small w onder tha t teachers became anxious and\\nconcerned in the ear ly 1990s. It seemed tha t science,as a way of knowing,thinking,and\\nworking,was not very comfortable for many primary school teachers.\\nThere is evidence tha t science as a w ay of working and as deﬁ ned by the National Cur riculum\\nis not well-understood amongst some pr imary school teachers. This seems to be compounded\\nby a lack of awareness of the function of the pr actical acti vity. While activities which illustrate\\nthe existence of a phenomenon ar e common, opportunities ar e not always taken to develop\\nthese into question-r aising or h ypothesis-g enerating activities for further investigation. While\\nteachers may believe that their acti vity exercises a wide r ange of skills and pr ocesses,in prac-\\ntice,they seem to be o ver-optimistic . (Newton,p. 17)\\nResearch also sho ws that teachers of younger students emphasiz e only certain scientiﬁ c\\nprocesses,such as obser vation and comm unication,with less time f or question-r aising and\\nhypothesis f ormation,and they concentr ate on the lif e sciences a t the expense of the ph ysical\\nsciences. A lack of appreciation of cer tain processes,such as questioning as a w ay of further-\\ning scientiﬁ c investigation,suggests that,pedagogically,teachers do not see their inher ent\\nvalue. Newton asks w hy some pr ocesses ar e neglected,and points to a f ailure to distinguish\\nthat certain activities feature certain kinds of pr ocesses (and content).\\nSeveral authors offer hope for reconciling the g ap between curriculum and implementa tion.\\nIn a chapter devoted to teac hers’conceptual under standing in science ,Russell et al., argue that\\nit is necessar y to mak e changes at both the pr eservice and in-ser vice levels.

Pr oductive reﬂection involves “doing something ,\\nthinking a bout how you did it, asking yourself how you could ha ve done it better ,and then\\ntrying to incor porate what you have learned in a similar situa tion.”In addition to this g eneral\\ncycle of reﬂection,the activities often ask students to compar e their approach/procedures with\\nthose used b y scientists. The overall structure of the ma terials contin ually provides students\\nwith oppor tunities to pur sue projects of their o wn choice. Concurrently,students ar e also in-\\nvited to complete acti vities that are speciﬁcally designed to emphasiz e various aspects of sci -\\nentiﬁc inquiry. It is belie ved that this organization allows teachers to provide students with\\nindirect help on their pr ojects while also encour aging independence .\\nThe Teacher’s Guideis especiall y useful f or the inf ormation it provides teac hers about\\nthe nature of science and scienti ﬁc inquiry. Of particular note is the guide’ s recognition\\nthat the nature and methods of scienti ﬁc inquiry have evolved over the last se veral hundred\\nyears. It is too easy f or curriculum ma terials and r eforms that focus on the na ture of sci-\\nence to assume incor rectly that science teac hers are knowledgeable in this ar ea. The\\nteacher’s guide could be signi ﬁcantly improved,however,with the ad dition of some a tten-\\ntion to assessment and e valuation. Given the open-ended na ture of the instr uctional a p-\\nproach and acti vities,teachers would be justi ﬁed in feeling uncer tain about how to\\nevaluate students’ work fairly.\\nThe curriculum ma terials are consistent with r ecent Nor th American reforms and per spec-\\ntives of science cur riculum,teaching,and learning. The focus on students de veloping and\\ncompleting inquir ies of their c hoice is a w elcome alter native to “traditional” practices. And,\\nas such,the author has car efully consider ed that students will need e xplicit instr uction on ho w\\nto design and complete indi vidual projects. The author has also pr ovided for the reality tha t\\nstudents will enter science c lasses with v arying levels of kno wledge and experience. Conse-\\nquently,various activities are presented as lo gical “starting points” based upon students’ back-\\nground knowledge.\\nThe descriptions often intr oduce vocabulary and conce pts that cause the r eader to question\\nthe author’ s assumptions a bout students’ background kno wledge. For example,in an acti vity\\nlabeled as a “beginning acti vity,”students ar e engaged with pud dles of w ater and the v arious\\nfactors that affect evaporation. Within this acti vity,silica gel is suggested as something tha t\\ncan dry air,and surface area is discussed without m uch explanation. Do students in mid dle\\nschool know what silica gel is,and why it is a dr ying agent? Do mid dle-school students pos -\\nsess the necessar y understanding of surf ace area?\\nThe author does an e xcellent job of ad dressing ho w “measures”of various types ar e devel-\\noped. In addition,attention is g iven to the impor tance of g raphing data and the pr os and cons\\nof various types of g raphs with r espect to speciﬁ c forms of data. The development of mea -\\nsurement systems and the cor rect representation of da ta are areas often ne glected in science\\ncurricula. The instructional ma terials appropriately stress that numerical data are not essential\\nto “good”science. However,the ultima te message is that quantiﬁ cation is a hallmar k of\\n“good”science. A more balanced a pproach would have been desir able given the common\\nmisconce ption that science and quantiﬁ cation are synonymous.\\nThe student’ s and teac her’s texts emphasiz e that there is no single set or sequence of ste ps\\nknown as the scientiﬁ c method . And the author should be a pplauded f or his distinctions be -\\ntween how science is actuall y done versus how it is reported in jour nals and the media. There\\nhas recently been much discussion concer ning the possibility tha t how science is r eported is at\\nleast partially responsible for the per petuation of the “scientiﬁc method” myth.

Unfortunately,there are two signiﬁcant conce ptual\\nproblems that serve to misrepresent the scientiﬁ c enterprise. First,as previously mentioned ,\\nthe implicit messa ge is that all scientiﬁ c investigations have a set of ste ps that are followed in\\na set sequence . Second,many activities in these cur riculum ma terials do not c learly distin-\\nguish betw een science and tec hnology. That is,in an attempt to str ess problem-solving skills,\\nmany of the acti vities present students with pr oblems to be solv ed,such as Archimedes’\\nscrew,bridge design, and Galileo’ s pendulum timer . These problems involve science,but are\\nmore akin to tec hnology and tec hnological method . There is nothing inher ently problematic\\nwith the af orementioned acti vities.

It\\nis refreshing to encounter the r ecent Problem Solving in Science and Technology,which fo-\\ncuses on impr oving the skill of pr oblem solving . Edited b y Mike Watts,this book has nine\\ncontributing author s and is di vided into thr ee sections: Extending Deﬁ nitions (tw o chapters);\\nExtending Conte xts (three chapters); and Extending Lear ners (four chapters). The following\\nsummarizes the book’ s contents and comments on its str engths and w eaknesses.\\nWhen I pick up a book on pr oblem solving ,I hope it will e xtend my theoretical perspective\\nas well as provide some pr actical acti vities for teaching and lear ning. Although Problem Solv-\\ning in Science and Technologydeﬁnitely neglects the theor etical side ,its strength lies in tak -\\ning the pr actical approach to problem solving . The book’s thesis is tha t success a t problem\\nsolving is de pendent upon ha ving a relevant human conte xt. Real-lif e problems that directly\\nimpact the en vironment,undergirded by science and tec hnology,provide such a conte xt\\nthroughout the book. This strategy resembles the model in w hich students ar e given a broken\\nradio and,in order to ﬁx it,must learn physics,electronics,and social skills. The book c harac-\\nterizes this inter disciplinar y strategy as learning on a “need to kno w”basis.\\nSection 1 consider s the skills and ca pabilities of pr oblem solving . Watts argues for the prac-\\ntical side of pr oblem solving ,which he deﬁnes as “that interaction betw een thinking and do -\\ning which embodies the inter meshing of thought and action” (p. 1). Watts identiﬁ es criteria of\\ngood problems,problem types, problem structures,problem-solving models, and procedures\\nfor solving pr oblems. He accur ately consider s “transfer”and “context”as major issues. While\\nproblem solving ha ppens in e very domain of human inquir y,it is “an open question as to\\nwhether or not the pr ocesses,skills and pr ocedures of problem solving ar e essentiall y the\\nsame in these dif ferent domains of under standing” (p. 4). Fur ther,“we cannot tr eat learning as\\ncontent-inde pendent—we are not robots or computer s who learn simple (or comple x) rou-\\ntines regardless of the task or cir cumstances in w hich it is to be under taken”(p. 7). Another\\nstrength of this section is its liber al view toward “technology”as anything from stone tools to\\nthe space shuttle . Technological problem solving or “technology capability”was deﬁned rela-\\ntive to the inter dependence of cor e qualities tha t included cognitive understanding,communi-\\ncations,process,values and judgments, and personal qualities as w ell as critical and cr eative\\nthinking: “The essence of a tec hnological approach to problem solving can be seen in the in -\\nteraction betw een the mind and e ye which comes to be e xpressed through action” (p. 24).\\nSection 2 pr esents a global vie w of problem solving b y discussing “tales”of how individu-\\nals in thir d-world countries use tec hnology to solve problems of basic li ving needs and cul -\\nture. Questions ar e raised about appropriate technological usage,about the r ole of tec hnology\\nin society ,and about the need f or sustaina ble practices tha t do not compr omise the en viron-\\nment. This section also descr ibes problem-solving acti vities from industr y,and presents useful\\nframeworks for curriculum design based on a comm union betw een problem solving ,industry,\\nand the en vironment. F or example,the PSI (Pr oblem Solving in Industr y) project uses r eal-\\nlife problems from the industr ial context to engage students in a ser ies of explicit ste ps that\\nculminate in a solution and in r eﬂective evaluation. Students ar e involved in such activities as\\ndata handling ,brainstorming,small group discussion, survey and research work,hands-on \\ninvestigations,and report writing. The section g ives several of examples of pr oblem solving\\nas a process that can be e xplicitly taught; it also pr ovides lists of pr oblem foci and pr oblem\\nbehaviors useful for the junior high sc hool or high sc hool teacher.\\nThe last section of the book descr ibes more case studies of pr oblem-solving acti vities with\\nprecollege students fr om a variety of bac kgrounds.

The\\nauthors wisely suggest that teachers must organize several prerequisites f or students’ problem\\nsolving to be successful. These components inc lude experience,exposure to theor y and ideas,\\nexplanations and inter pretations of ideas, and examination of results and solutions f or the pur -\\nposes of r eﬁnement. Dur ing problem solving ,students became “active learners”with shar ed\\nresponsibilities and shar e ownership of ideas. As might be e xpected,teachers found them -\\nselves changing their r ole from leader s to participant facilitators,and they spent m uch less\\ntime trying to co ver content.\\nA ﬁnal part of this section consider s strategies for encour aging and pr eparing teachers to\\nengage their students in pr oblem-solving pur suits. Guidelines descr ibe how to deal with the\\nneed for greater organization,with the loss of student contr ol,and with the loss of contr ol\\nover the material to be lear ned. The following seems typical of teac hers who are attempting to\\nteach problem solving:\\nI have enough dif ﬁculties keeping year 8 seated,let alone g etting them to beha ve when they\\nare performing open-ended pr oblem-solving acti vities; problem solving is lik e letting the lid\\noff a can of w orms. (p. 134)\\nIt is suggested that barriers to problem solving ma y be overcome if teac hers use an e xperien-\\ntial learning cycle with a v ariety of cross-curricular problem-solving e xercises. These should\\ninclude stages of active experimentation,concrete experience,reﬂective observation,and ab-\\nstract conce ptualization. It is commenda ble that the book tak es a reﬂective/constructivist ap-\\nproach as it descr ibes teacher educa tion in pr oblem solving: “Theirs is the task of tr anslating\\nideas for learning into pr actice—experimenting with ne w approaches to see w hat works best\\nin their own circumstances” (p. 144).\\nAmerican readers who are unfamiliar with the Br itish educa tional system ma y ﬁnd the\\nbook’s references to the “National Cur riculum”somewhat perplexing. Some kno wledge of\\nthis major cur riculum de velopment and the ensuing contr oversy might be useful bac kground\\nfor readers. The American science educa tor might ﬁ nd it valuable to compar e curriculum\\nchange and reform efforts in the tw o countries. Another f eature of the book is the inc lusion of\\na few chapters devoted to reporting results based on qualita tive research. Some r eaders may\\nﬁnd these c hapters to give insufﬁcient detail a bout the qualita tive methods used ,and about the\\ntheoretical per spectives framing the w ork. A further feature of the collection is tha t its con-\\ntributors are not representative of science teac hers,although this might be e xpected of a book\\non problem solving in science .

The author s treat assessment as inte gral to educa -\\ntional endea vors and,in doing so, raise some br oad questions as to w hat education is about. In\\nparticular,they treat teaching and assessment as inter twined. The term “active assessment” is\\nused to deﬁ ne a range of methods tha t resonate with John Dewey’s concerns for children to be\\nactive in their constr uction of meaning . The book pr ovides examples of acti ve assessment, but\\nsuggests that it is for each teacher to develop his or her o wn style in the a pplication of the\\ntechniques discussed .\\nThe author s refer to extensive experience of w orking with sc hool distr icts across the USA,\\npointing out tha t traditional and limiting f orms of assessment r emain per vasive. However,a\\ngrowing political emphasis on science educa tion and cur rent directions in r esearch into chil-\\ndren’s conceptual under standing ma y have set the scene f or questioning tr aditional limita tions\\nand moving toward a more enlightened a pproach. The author s identify an enem y:inadequate\\ntests which reinforce low-level thinking . They also reveal a vision of teac hers using all possi -\\nble means of making judgments a bout students’ outcomes in the cour se of their “learning the\\ncontent of science w hile engaging in its pr ocesses.”\\nThe second c hapter is the long est in the book b y far,and details a wide r epertoire of assess -\\nment techniques. By ad dressing pre- and postunit assessment possibilities, the author s draw\\nattention to the impor tance of students’ own conce ptions and ho w these change.The various\\nmodes of collecting inf ormation are illustrated with e xamples of students’ own words,draw-\\nings and other outcomes of their thinking . The author s stress that it is for teachers to make\\ntheir own selection of the methods to be used accor ding to the a ge and experience of students\\nand to the ma terial that has been taught. The chapter does not a ttempt to distinguish betw een\\ndifferent curricular objecti ves at this poin t—for example,between conce pts,processes,and\\nattitudes,although eac h is illustr ated in passing .

They recommend an open and tr ansparent approach,both within the sc hool and to -\\nward parents and administr ators.\\nThe author s offer a fresh perspective on assessment in their c hapter,“Curriculum De velop-\\ners Talk About Assessment, ”in which three curriculum de velopers are invited to shar e their\\nanguish a bout whatto assess, when,how frequently,and how.This is an inter esting idea. It\\nemphasiz es the complementar ity of cur riculum and assessment, teaching and lear ning out-\\ncomes. Decisions ha ve to be made a bout what the “big ideas” might be,for these will be the\\nassessment tar gets. The issue of de velopmental dif ferences in under standing is r aised in this\\nchapter. There is also the mor e prosaic advice to teac hers searching for appropriate assess-\\nments to look bac k at one of the acti vities in the unit the y have just taught.\\nAdvice is offered on the inter pretation of children’s work,either against predetermined cri-\\nteria or as a joint e xercise betw een collea gues in an open-ended a ttempt to shar pen interpre-\\ntive skills. This is critically important because inter pretation lacks purpose in the a bsence of\\ncriteria for intended lear ning outcomes, implicit or e xplicit. Fur thermore,without an y refer-\\nence to a cur ricular agenda,the manner in w hich topics ar e presented to c hildren and de vel-\\noped in comple xity through consecuti ve years of schooling cannot be a consider ation.\\nThis takes us into the ar ea of whole-school curriculum planning w hich,although essential to\\nbear in mind along with teac hing and assessment, is not part of the stor y of the book under r e-\\nview. Positively speaking ,the discussion of the inter pretation of children’s work conﬁrms that\\nyoung children’s output r ewards close scrutiny. Young people’ s ideas justify being tak en seri-\\nously even when erroneous in ter ms of con ventional scientiﬁ c understanding. This is so be -\\ncause their dr awings,writings,and verbalizations tell us w hat is going on inside their heads,\\nand such information is invaluable to the teac her determined to optimiz e the next learning ex-\\nperience in the sequence . In this sense ,the discussion on inter preting children’s ideas succeeds.\\nIt might be f elt that there is a lack of speciﬁ city in the cr iteria which are referred to in pass -\\ning (e.g.,“concepts,”“skills in using equipment, ”“processes,”etc.). This is explained to ward\\nthe end of the book, where the author s make this inter esting comment:\\nFor most of y ou,the national effort to develop criteria and standar ds for science educa tion are\\nless relevant than y our need to de velop speciﬁ c criteria for scoring day-to-day science acti vi-\\nties in your classrooms. No ma tter what the national goals for science educa tion might be ,you\\nneed to decide w hat you expect your children to lear n and under stand from the acti vities you\\nintroduce to them. (p. 177)\\nThis sentiment e xplained to me the a bsence of something in the book w hich arguably should\\nbe central to diagnostic and f ormative assessment, namely,a consider ation not just of w here\\nchildren are coming fr om (the impor tance of w hich the author s certainly emphasiz e),but\\nwhere they are going. Conceptual diagnosis offers the possibility of etiolo gy,but also pr ogno-\\nsis; if we have a clear curricular agenda,we can star t to get a handle on the cr ucial issue of\\nconceptual progression. It per mits teachers to address the issue w hich Piagetians used to r efer\\nto as “the problem of the ma tch,”although toda y’s constructivists will fr ame the same pr ob-\\nlem in mor e domain-speciﬁ c terms:“What are the mor e important landmar ks in children’s\\ncoming to under stand the scientiﬁ c conceptualization of light, or evaporation?,”and so on.\\nAnother ar ea which the author s touch on in their c hapter on scor ing,but which in my expe-\\nrience would beneﬁ t from a fuller tr eatment,is the relationship betw een criterion-referenced\\nand norm-referenced assessments. So f ew people ,politicians especiall y,seem to a ppreciate\\nthat these options ar e not unrelated alternatives,but closely complementar y. If a pupil is g iven\\na standard score on a test, we really should be asking a gainst what criteria performance was\\nassessed. Equally,given a criterion-related performance,it is reasonable to ask w hat propor-\\ntion of the popula tion of the a ge group assessed met tha t criterion.622BOOKREVIEWS\\n 1098237x, 1997, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199709)81:5<605::AID-SCE8>3.0.CO;2-E by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

In the 1990s, perhaps the liveliestissue has been multiculturalism. The debate began in the pages of Science Education in\\n1993, with Derek Hodson’s elegant rationale for a multicultural science education that issensitive to cultural context. Hodson described a science education that would do no vi-olencetotheculturalbeliefsofstudentswhodidnotsharethestandardculturalframeworkof modern science. To this rationale came Williams’ (1994, p. 515) retort that Hodson’sproposal to “avoid ‘doing violence’ to [students’] cultural and ethnic beliefs and experi-ences by including them under the rubric of science” would in fact doviolencetoscience.Science is universal and, hence, cannot rationally be understood in terms of multicultur-alism. But, before Williams (1994) was even in print, Bill Stanley and Nancy Brickhouse(1994) opened a new round in the debate exactly on the epistemological point of univer-salism.\\nStanley and Brickhouse (1994) argued that the standard universalist account of the\\nnature of science was ﬂawed, and that the nature of science, in fact, “should reﬂect amulticultural perspective of scientiﬁc knowledge” (p. 387). Such a provocative assertionbrought swift responses. Good (1995) strongly rejected the idea that the school sciencecurriculashouldbeexpandedforculturalreasons,andLoving(1995)raisedconcernsaboutthe nature of the ideas multicultualists wanted to include under the banner of science.However, Masakata Ogawa (1995, p. 583) extended the argument for multiculturalisminscience education by asserting “the existence of various types of science”andspeciﬁcallyreferredtomodernscienceas“Westernmodernscience.”And,sinceOgawa’s1995article,ScienceEducation hasaddedseveralotherarticlesoncultureandscienceeducationissues.\\nTheseincludeCobern’s1996articlethatdiscussedconceptualchangefromtheperspectiveof worldview theory adopted from cultural anthropology; Aikenhead’s 1997 article thatdiscussedaconceptofscienceeducationas“border-crossing”(p.217);andHodson’s1999article which offered a “set of proposals for a radical form of multicultural science edu-cation for sociopolitical action” (p. 775).\\nAll of which brings us to our current issue of Science Education. TheJournalispleased\\nto present a continuation of the science education/multiculturalism debate in the form ofanorganizedarticlesetthatinvolvesauthorsfromAfrica,theMiddleEast,NorthAmerica,the Paciﬁc Islands, and Scandinavia. The three plenary articles by Snively and Corsiglia,Stanley and Brickhouse, and Cobern and Loving are based on papers presented during asymposium on multiculturalism at the 1998 National Association for Research in ScienceTeaching Annual Meeting. Prior to acceptance, the manuscripts for the plenary articleswere reviewed according to the Journal’s standard practice. The letters of response weresolicited by the section editor to represent both a variety of viewpoints and geographicallocations.\\nWe anticipate that the combination of plenary articles followed by solicited responses\\nwill lend itself to considerable pedagogical use.

In this issue, John Rudolph makes note of the history of this journal, whichbegan in 1916 as General Science Quarterly , with an article by John Dewey entitled “Method\\nin Science Teaching.” In 1929, the journal’s name was changed to Science Education .Ih a v e\\nbeen overseeing the review process for Science Education since August 2001. Much of my\\neffort up to this point has been in setting up the editorial ofﬁce to manage the review process.Since some of the ﬁrst manuscripts reviewed under my tenure appear in this issue, it seemspropitious for me to articulate some of my goals for the journal.\\nI want to assure that authors receive timely and valuable feedback on their manuscripts.\\nI believe we have already improved the review process by utilizing Manuscript Central,a web-based review process. Manuscript Central was launched in May 2002. Since then,use of the system has steadily increased such that we now receive over half our submis-sions via Manuscript Central. Manuscripts submitted to this web site generally undergoa faster review process because they spend less time in the mail. This is particularly trueof manuscripts that are authored or reviewed by individuals outside the United States. Inthe ﬁrst 6 months of my editorship, the average time between submission of a manuscriptand a decision by the editor based on external reviews was about 5 months. I expect thisnumber has improved considerably with more manuscripts being reviewed on ManuscriptCentral.\\nEqually as important as timely reviews is the quality of the feedback to the authors. Here\\nI am particularly dependent on a pool of expert and committed reviewers. I am pleased withthe responsiveness of senior scholars in science education (and at times, outside scienceeducation) to review for Science Education . I am working to expand the list of reviewers\\nto encompass the kinds of expertise needed in writing good reviews for the broad rangeof manuscripts submitted to Science Education . I try to send manuscripts to reviewers that\\nthey will want to read—and I try not to ask too often. My decisions regarding reviewers aredriven by three criteria: Do they have the relevant expertise? Have they written high qualityreviews in the past? How many manuscripts can this particular reviewer handle? When thereviewer has the right kind of expertise and a sense of the instructional function served bythe review, then the helpfulness of the review is typically high.\\nI will judge my own success as editor by whether or not the articles that appear in the\\njournal are credible and signiﬁcant. My hope is that readers will be excited when the latestissue of the journal arrives because they anticipate, based on past experience, that this issuewill have several articles in it that they will want to read right away. Judging the qualityof a journal is not easily quantiﬁed. One method that is often used for judging quality isthe impact factor, which is basically an assessment of how often articles in the journal arecited. Science Education is consistently in the top 25 out of over 100 journals in education\\nand educational research. We are frequently ranked in the top 10.\\nArticles should be signiﬁcant to readers across the globe. I want to encourage U.S. authors\\nto think carefully about how their work might speak to those in Hong Kong, Norway, orSouth Africa, and vice versa. Reading literature published by authors living in a variety ofcountries is a good starting place.\\nC/circlecopyrt2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\nDOI 10.1002/sce.100892BRICKHOUSE\\nIt is my hope that Science Education will continue to include scholarship that pushes\\nthe boundaries of the ﬁeld. While the journal will continue to publish scholarship that ﬁts\\nwell within mainstream discourse in science education, the Editorial Board and I place ahigh value on scholarship that encourages us to think differently about the work we do. Thejournal ’s beginning with the work of John Dewey is the right message for today. Scholarship\\nthat is still read and debated 86 years after its initial publication is a value of this journal Ihope to encourage.\\nNANCY W.

Sci-\\nence educators are increasingly aware of the role of policy in their research and practice.Some seek input from education policy makers and analysts as they design, conduct, anddisseminate their research. Others engage policy makers about questions in science educa-tion. Still others seek to undertake research that increases understanding of and inﬂuencesscience education policy. Frequently, policy sways those who fund education research intheir decisions about what problems and projects are worthy of support. Ideally, researchand policy in science education should inﬂuence each other.\\nOne example of an interaction between policy and research in science education is the\\neffect in some countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). PISA includes science,as well as literacy and mathematics, as the disciplines that provide students with the knowl-edge and skills essential for full participation in society. For PISA, “Scientiﬁc literacy isthe capacity to use scientiﬁc knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-basedconclusions in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and thechanges made to it through human activity (OECD, 2003a).” The PISA survey, administeredto 15-year-olds in principal industrialized nations on a three-year cycle, highlighted liter-acy in 2000 and mathematics in 2003 and will highlight science in 2006. Even though the2000 PISA survey highlighted literacy, there were some questions that addressed scientiﬁcliteracy. Figure 1 is an example of a public domain PISA task in science (OECD, 2003b):\\nFigure 1. An example of a science task in the PISA survey.\\nGermany was among the countries ranked as performing signiﬁcantly below the OECD\\naverage in scientiﬁc literacy (Stanat et al., 2002). This outcome has triggered a carefulexamination of the science curriculum in Germany. The decisions to participate in theOECD Programme and to examine the curriculum are policy decisions of the Germangovernment. However, science education researchers are leading the discussions and theredesign of the science curriculum. Policy is providing an impetus for science educationresearch in the area of curriculum design.\\nC/circlecopyrt2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\nDOI 10.1002/sce.101402COLLINS\\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS, formerly named\\nThird International Mathematics and Science Study) is another international study in whichgovernments decided to participate and then publicize the results to highlight reasons foreducation policies. TIMSS is beginning to have in ﬂuence on research and practice in science\\neducation beyond those directly involved in TIMSS. As one example, TIMSS researcherscreated categories to describe the teachers ’and students ’actions during instruction as these\\nactions were captured on videotape. Researchers are now using these categories as a startingpoint in the design of studies responsive to questions about how novice science teacherslearn to become re ﬂective practitioners. A research tool developed speci ﬁcally for a study\\nintended to in ﬂuence policy is gaining wider use in science education research.\\nThe examples of policies that in ﬂuence science education at the national level are numer-\\nous. For example, in the United States, science educators are aware of the No Child LeftBehind Act (NCLB). This legislation requires teachers and administrators to be publiclyaccountable for the academic achievement of all students. The NCLB Act also emphasizesthat the instructional programs and practices used in schools have been demonstrated to beeffective through scienti ﬁc research. Funding for research and development of curriculum\\nmaterials is in ﬂuenced by such a policy. Other recent policy documents in the United States\\ninclude the Glenn Report, Before It ’s Too Late: A Report to the Nation (The National Com-\\nmission on Mathematics and Science Education for the 21st Century, 2000). The messageof the Glenn report is that America ’s students must improve their performance in math-\\nematics and science if they are to succeed in today ’s world. The report recommends that\\nthe most direct route to improving mathematics and science achievement for all studentsis better mathematics and science teaching. To improve the quality of teacher preparationand make continuing professional education available for all teachers, the report providesgoals and strategies. The effectiveness of these strategies proposed in a policy document isa researchable question.\\nThe United States is not alone in developing policy that affects science education. In\\nAustralia, the New South Wales Department of Education and Training is developing stan-dards for teachers with performance criteria. The Royal Society of England ’s Education\\nCommittee held open meetings in fall 2003 in order to produce key recommendations topolicy makers by summer 2004 on the assessment of science learning in schools and col-leges for students aged 14 –19. In 2000 the World Bank made available a paper on Mapping\\nScience Education Policy in Developing Countries (Lewin, 2000). Each of these policiesintroduces opportunities for research. Policies of a state, district, or school likewise provideopportunities for research.\\nRecognizing the need for a forum for articles on science education policy, we introduce\\nthis new section. For this section, a science education policy is de ﬁned as a course or prin-\\nciple of action adopted by a government, interest group, school district, school, or teacher,etc., and directed towards any aspect of an individual ’s or group ’s science learning and\\nteaching. De ﬁned as such, policy is a goal-directed behavior. Policy issues arise whenever\\nthe adopted course of action, the principles underlying it, or the desired goals of the actionare contested. Studies of science education policy enhance understanding of (a) the valuejudgments, con ﬂicts, and ethical concerns that underlie policy issues; (b) the alternative\\npolicies that might be pursued; (c) the social, organizational, economic, and psychologicalfactors that bear upon policy and limit or augment its effectiveness; and (d) the implemen-tation and consequences of policy in concrete settings. Science education policy research,so conceived, is committed to the critical examination of policy issues affecting scienceeducation and the integration of theory, research, and practice.\\nAuthors engaged in science education policy research and practice, as de ﬁned and outlined\\nabove, are invited to submit manuscripts for the section on Science Education Policy.

Auden’s poem, subtitled “A Reactionary Tract for the Times,” rails against ele-ments of a mass tertiary education and celebrates both intellectual and sensual exploration.His concerns about ﬁrst-year students at Harvard, Princeton, and Yale remind me of teachereducation students who approach their programs with the view that there is a ﬁnite set of clearrules of procedure that, when followed, lead to good teaching. Research students mirror thisbehavior if they slavishly follow detailed steps for ensuring that their quasi-experimentaldesigns meet criteria for validity. Neither are students of qualitative research immune fromthe infection of checklists. As Webb and Glesne (1992) noted, “Some students assume thata qualitative research class will provide procedures that, if followed faithfully, will producewarranted research results” (p. 775). But what is meant by “warranted research results”? Forme there is more to “warranted research results” than having the researcher satisfy familiarchecklists, such as those in the ﬁve editions of McMillan and Schumacher’s Research in\\nEducation: A Conceptual Introduction (McMillan & Schumacher, 1984–2001)—a text that\\nI use once or twice a year when I teach an introductory research methods course. In thiscourse, I try to have students understand that, ultimately, our research is a human enterpriseand that its worth is more than simply its trustworthiness. So although “warranted researchresults” has something to do with trustworthiness and with concepts like reliability andvalidity, I know that there is more. In this piece, I explore the character of rigor and its placein discussions about the quality of our research, so that we can move away from overworkedparadigm wars and from the ambiguity of reliability and validity.\\nThere was a time when the idea that rigor might reside in qualitative educational research\\nwas almost ridiculed. But paradigm wars existed in other disciplines before we declared themin education, so issues of rigor lie beyond debates about qualitative and quantitative research.For example, among my readings as a doctoral student in the late 1960s was the debate aboutthe function of history with Hempel (1968) proposing explanations for human behaviors as\\nAn earlier version of this paper was an invited address at the annual meeting of the National Association\\nfor Research on Science Teaching, St. Louis, MO, March 2001. This paper is from the research program“Co-op Education and Workplace Learning” (Hugh Munby, Nancy Hutchinson, and Peter Chin, PrincipalInvestigators).\\nThis research is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.\\n1The study of education was not the only object of Auden’s witty scorn (Auden, 1979): “Do not sit with\\nstatisticians nor commit a social science” is an equally memorable injunction from the same poem.\\nC/circlecopyrt2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\\nDOI 10.1002/sce.10096154 MUNBY\\ndeductions from general laws; against this, Dray (1957) and others arguing for the unique\\ncharacter of historical explanation lodged within a singular context. I recently encounteredthis conversation continued in letters between proponents and opponents of quanti ﬁcation\\nin Aydelotte ’sQuanti ﬁcation in History (Aydelotte, 1971), and I recalled the importance of\\ndistinguishing between two kinds of argument in this context. The ﬁrst kind is about what\\noverarching approach is proper and should be taken to research. The debate between Hempeland Dray typi ﬁes this kind of argument. The second kind of argument is about the quality\\nof the research itself, and this is where reliability and validity have found employment.\\nThe other side to the paradigm wars is the evidence that we were and still are comfortable\\nwhen scholarly work from one paradigm is approached from the vantage point of another.An example is Conant ’s richly informative and literary accounts of experimental science\\nfrom an historical perspective (Conant, 1957), which opened my eyes to the fundamentalcharacter of science. What I saw was quite different from what I had been taught at schooland university, yet it enriched what I had been taught. So it is that I ﬁnd Bruner ’s claim\\n(Bruner, 1996), “The process of science making is narrative ”(p. 126), unsurprising as he\\ndescribes the difference between ﬁnished science and the “lively processes ”(p. 127) of\\nscience making. In this light, we can imagine how we have become accepting of alternativeapproaches to educational research. Similarly, we should not be surprised to ﬁnd sections on\\nbivariate and multivariate statistics in LeCompte and Schensul ’sAnalyzing and Interpreting\\nEthnographic Data (LeCompte & Schensul, 1999). It is as if “paradigm wars ”have become\\nparadigm rapprochements in which different viewpoints let us see better the human conditionwithin our research. In turn, this suggests to me that there is more to assessing research thanwhat is conveyed by reliability and validity.\\nRELIABILITY AND VALIDITY: MEANINGS FROM REPUTABLE SOURCES\\nThe terms validity and reliability handily predate current use in research,\\n2but the student\\nof research will ﬁnd precise contemporary meaning elusive. For example, reliability in the\\nquantitative social sciences is connected with the reproducibility of results, and it has cometo be associated with agreement across cases and observations. Most particularly, the termbecomes a property of instruments for mental measurement (Gould & Kolb, 1964), althoughreliability or stability of data can be concerned with the reliability of the observer, the coder,and the analyst. And this sense seems to coincide with how the term may appear in qualitativeresearch, especially in ethnographic work. But as we pursue this, so the matter becomescomplex. For example, studies themselves, experimental or descriptive, can be judged forreliability. Goetz and LeCompte (1984) state that “Reliability refers to the extent to which\\nstudies can be replicated ”(p. 211), and so “external reliability addresses the issue of whether\\nindependent researchers would discover the same phenomena or would generate the sameconstructs in the same or similar settings ”(p. 210) while internal reliability “refers to the\\ndegree to which other researchers, given a set of previously generated constructs, wouldmatch them with data in the same way as did the original researcher ”(p. 210). This becomes\\nconfusing when the authors attempt crisp de ﬁnitions of validity (p. 210):\\nInternal validity refers to the extent to which scienti ﬁc observations and measurements are\\nauthentic representations of some reality; external validity refers to the degree to whichsuch representations can be compared legitimately across groups.\\n2For example, the Oxford English Dictionary (Simpson & Weiner, 1989) reports that “validity ”was\\nused circa 1550, and that Coleridge used “reliability ”in 1816 some 90 years before the term appeared in\\ntheAmerican Journal of Psychology .\\n 1098237x, 2003, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.10096 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nDISCIPLINED INQUIRY 155\\nThese ideas cohere well with the entries in A Dictionary of the Social Sciences , although\\nwe might be justi ﬁed in being confused by the idea of “corroboration of one ’s data ”(Gould\\n& Kolb, 1964, p. 742) because it resembles ideas of reliability. The same sense of cor-roboration exists in McMillan and Schumacher ’s account of internal validity (McMillan\\n& Schumacher, 1997): “Validity of qualitative designs is the degree to which the inter-\\npretations and conceptual categories have mutual meanings between the participants andthe researcher ”(p. 404). And their de ﬁnition of external validity differs from the de ﬁni-\\ntion of Goetz and LeCompte (1984), but they put the concept in terms of comparabilityor extension, even usefulness of a study, “the degree to which the research design is ad-\\nequately described so that researchers may use the study to extend the ﬁndings to other\\nstudies ”(p. 411). The student might be further frustrated in a quest for clarity if he or she\\nencountered texts in which conventional terms like “internal validity, ”“external validity, ”\\n“reliability, ”and“objectivity ”are replaced respectively by “credibility, ”“transferability, ”\\n“dependability, ”and“conﬁrmability ”(Hoep ﬂ, 2000, p. 9). Other versions of the terms and\\ntheir meanings exist, as in Moschkovich and Brenner (2000, p. 479).\\nMy confusion is not eased when I consider the large number of terms used in qualitative\\nresearch for expressing validity and reliability, nor when I see that meanings tend to besomewhat mobile. My experience is that this state of affairs is unwelcome to graduatestudents in research courses, but more importantly it may be leading me and them inthe wrong direction. The enterprise of discussing validity and reliability from varyingviewpoints can too quickly involve us in debates about word usage. Unfortunately, this candistract us from seeing that research at its most fundamental is an argument that leads us\\nthrough purpose, related literature, data, and analysis to a speci ﬁc point.\\n3\\nRIGOR, ARGUMENT, AND POINT\\nI believe we can make progress if we focus on argument itself. Certainly, the confusion\\nabout validity in mental measurement has pro ﬁted from a similar switch in vantage point.\\nViews of test validity have changed markedly over the last half century. In the 1950s, validitywas construed in four separate ways: content validity, predictive validity, concurrent validity,and construct validity (APA, 1954). And 35 years later, we ﬁnd Messick (1989) developing\\nhis position that these are not separate forms but are evidence for the one form: constructvalidity. Validity in this frame is an argument . A similar commitment to argument is evident\\nin Mischler ’s position (Mischler, 1990). He draws on his experience in narrative research to\\nshow that validity is less important than the process of validation. He argues that “validation\\nis the social construction of a discourse through which the results of a study come to beviewed as trustworthy for other investigators to rely upon in their own work ”(p. 426). The\\nattention to process suggests the promise of looking at argument to get a fuller sense ofwhat is involved in the concepts of reliability and validity and how they might contributeto rigor and to showing the human character of our research.\\nI am far from comfortable that validity and reliability tell us all that should be told about\\nthe quality of research in education. The concepts seem necessary but not suf ﬁcient for a full\\naccount. What discussions of trustworthiness, credibility, reliability, validity seem to lack isthe sense that research has a purpose . Here I am not referring to the purpose we might ﬁnd in\\na section called “Statement of Purpose. ”Rather, I am interested in what we think research\\nthat we do is for: What is its point? Again, the standard accounts are a little deceptive.\\n3Roberts (1982) uses diagrams from Toulmin ’s ideas about the structure of argument to show that\\nalthough different empirical research modes have different metaphysical premises and warrants, they sharea common commitment to argument based on data.\\n 1098237x, 2003, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.10096 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

In fairness they then consider several different\\nuses of research and develop these into basic (pure or fundamental), applied, and evaluativefunctions of research. None of this is contestable, it ’s just incomplete. For example, it fails to\\nacknowledge that, among other things, research is to persuade. In the next section, I exploreaspects of rigor by considering research purposes. All this is to suggest that conventionaltools like reliability and validity are simply not up to the task of portraying what needs tobe said about the quality and usefulness of research.\\nWhat I think we need to show to our research students is how the constructs we build in\\neducational research get transported into arenas of professional practice, into the settings inwhich they can be used. My experience is that this transportation is not always successful.There seems to be a membrane between the constructs of research and arenas of practice.Presumably, if our constructs were objective, in some sense, the membrane would be easyto cross. But that option is not available to us.\\nWhen educational researchers no longer see the possibility of objectivity as a life option,\\none reaction has been to focus on their subjectivity, to worry about it, and to turn it into aset of methodological concerns. For a number of researchers, anxiety about how to be asobjective as possible has been translated into anxiety about how to manage subjectivity asrigorously as possible. (Heshusius, 1994, p. 15)\\nThere are several ways in which researchers have reacted to the challenge. Heshusius,\\nfor example, advocates a methodology of participatory consciousness. My approach israther different, indeed it starts from a different place. Basically, I do not think I have everbeen wedded to objectivity itself because of the character of the knowledge produced byeducational research, and because of its point. Indeed, I ﬁnd a focus on point or purpose\\nparticularly helpful in describing something of the range of debates that we should enterwhen we consider rigor seriously. As I show below, these debates should include issues ofethics, professionalism, and rhetoric.\\nETHICS AND RIGOR\\nI became concerned about issues of ethics and their relationship to rigor within educational\\nresearch when I was asked to write on the signi ﬁcance of qualitative research (Munby, 1983,\\np. 424).\\nThe unquestionable purpose of the enterprise of educational research is the improvement of\\neducation. Generally, setting aside research that is more conceptual in nature, it is easy tosee that quantitative and qualitative investigations of school events are designed to improvewhat occurs in educational institutions. While the foci of this work may run from research onclassroom learning to research on curriculum change, the ultimate change held as the end-in-view has to be change in teaching practice, because what really counts is the chalkface,curriculum-in-use facet of the endeavor. Here, though, there is an implicit assumption thatteaching is the sort of activity that canbe changed. The corollary is that teachers can be\\nchanged. Of course, accompanying these assertions is the driving belief that research isworthwhile because teachers need to be changed.\\nFor me, it is important to capture the idea that research activity begins with a normative\\npremise. It has never been suf ﬁcient to justify research in terms of knowledge for its own\\nsake. Indeed, I have come to think that all propositional knowledge is in the service ofaction (Munby, Chin, & Hutchinson, in press), and action is clearly normative. In part, the\\n 1098237x, 2003, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.10096 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nDISCIPLINED INQUIRY 157\\nnormative nature of our research is re ﬂected in our insistence that there be a rationale for the\\nwork. My hope is that the insistence carries into explicit statements about the value premisesunderlying the proposed work. Without these, I think the research would fall somewhat shortof meeting a standard of rigor, and that standard is patently not an objective one when valuepremises are at issue.\\nPROFESSIONALISM AND RIGOR\\nIn an earlier paper, I argued the impossibility of smoothly moving from generalizable\\nresearch results to changing teachers principally because the particular circumstances of ateacher ’s action will be different from those in which the research was conducted (Munby,\\n1983). In quantitative research, we recognize this issue as a version of the separations amongtarget population, sample population, and sample. In qualitative research we recognize thisissue as part of the character of the research too: there is no pretense to generalizability.Here the membrane between research knowledge and professional practice is more than amatter of logic though. Professional assimilation in the ﬁeld also plays a part.\\nDiscussions about professionalism are almost as wide-ranging as de ﬁnitions of what\\nprofessionalism entails: in the latter we ﬁnd (a) the contrast between doing something for\\npay and doing something free, (b) the idea that being professional involves a distancing ordetachment (as in calling penalties while refereeing), (c) the suggestion that a degree ofproﬁciency if not excellence has been achieved, and (d) the social distinction among classes\\nthat might be re ﬂected in discriminating among occupations, vocations, and careers (Soder,\\n1990). Some of these discussions tend to agree that professionalism is bound to the idea ofa professional knowledge base (e.g., Fenstermacher, 1990).\\nColleagues and I have argued that “the essence of professionalism is professional action ”\\n(Munby, Russell, & Martin, 2001) and that teaching should be in the best interests of theclients and thus based upon the best available knowledge. But as shown in our chapter inthe fourth edition of the Handbook of Research on Teaching , the character of teachers ’\\nknowledge is the subject of debate and con ﬂicting theoretical viewpoints. This makes the\\ntransition of research knowledge into professional practice highly complex. And in turn,questions about the quality and value of educational research automatically get extendedbeyond the simple language of reliability and validity. A sense of rigor is called for that hon-ors both the moral premises of research purpose and the integrity of professional knowledgeand judgment, without violating the professionalism of the educator.\\nRIGOR AND THE RESEARCHER’S PROFESSIONALISM\\nTheOxford English Dictionary (Simpson & Weiner, 1989) reports many senses of “rigor ”\\nfrom strict application of the law, through hardness of heart, to strict accuracy and severeexactitude, a phrase that seems to refer to lexicography itself. Also we have seen howrigor gets entwined with professionalism, so it is ﬁtting to turn the lens on the professional\\nactions of the researcher herself or himself and to ask how rigor gets played out in thatarena.\\nI doubt that I am alone in wondering along with graduate students at the quantity of\\nresearch decisions we face that are not strictly guided by anything epistemological. Ques-tions like, “How many participants should I really have? ”“Are eight interviews enough? ”\\n“Should I attempt another administration of the test or simply go for a split-half assessment\\nof consistency? ”As a graduate supervisor, I often ﬁnd myself saying, “This is just a masters\\nthesis, not a career ”thereby truncating research on purely pragmatic grounds. Of course, the\\nsection titled “Limitations ”always accounts for how practicality may compromise rigor, but\\n 1098237x, 2003, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.10096 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Among\\nmy favorite quiet compromises are the following.\\nThe ﬁrst is the practiced convention we seem to have developed for the reliability of\\ninstruments. Noting that reliability is a function of the nature of the trait (construct) beingmeasured, McMillan and Schumacher (2001) state, “a reliability of .80 or above is gener-\\nally accepted for achievement variables, whereas estimates of .70 may be acceptable formeasuring personality traits ”(p. 249). I spent an early part of my career wondering about\\nthe reliability and validity of attitude measures. I won ’t go into details here, but it is worth\\nobserving that reliability in this sense has become something of a rhetorical device ratherthan an epistemological one.\\nThe second example is the threat to internal validity of treatment replications: “In an\\nexperiment, the treatment is supposed to be repeated so that each of the members of onegroup receives the same treatment separately and independently of the other membersof the group ”(McMillan & Schumacher, 2001, p. 191). If an instructional treatment is\\nconducted once in one class, then the class is like one subject. The sample size is thenumber of treatments , not the number of subjects . The threat of treatment replications\\nrefers to instances when the reported number of subjects is not the same as number oftreatments.\\nI wonder if we are deceiving our students when we fail to show the shortcuts that we take.\\nOf course, corners have to be cut because life is short and we cannot wait upon certainty. Iam not defending compromises, but I am asking that we acknowledge that rigor is deeplyconnected to them in our own professional practice.\\nRIGOR, PERSUASION, AND RHETORIC\\nI know that I am not alone in trying to push for inspecting aspects of rigor in qualitative\\nresearch. Sandelowski (1993) for example, recognizing “the danger of succumbing to ‘the\\nillusion of technique ”’(p. 1), argued that “rigor is less about adherence to the letter of rules\\nand procedures than it is about ﬁdelity to the spirit of qualitative work ”(p. 2). True to a\\ncertain extent, but too ephemeral for me. I think rigor refers to more than the spirit of theresearch, whether qualitative or quantitative. As we have seen, an element of rhetoric seemsto be lurking in some of the steps we take in our research. Some argue that the element ofrhetoric in quantitative research is of signi ﬁcant proportions:\\nThe language of statistics is but one form of rhetoric; however, it is a rhetoric that, for certain\\naudiences and in certain circumstances can be more compelling and more functional thana case study, poem, or autoethnographic report. (Gergen & Gergen, 2000, p. 1033)\\nThe term “rhetoric ”may have unjustly received bad press. Although the term is sometimes\\nused to re ﬂect insincerity or exaggeration, its origins are in the work of Isocrates; and its\\nelaboration during the Renaissance by Erasmus and others (Shrag, 1992, p. 271) gave it itsdistinctive meaning of argument and persuasion. As Shrag puts it in his discussion of thetraditions of knowledge (p. 272):\\nThe rhetorical tradition realizes the limitations of philosophical argument as a vehicle\\nfor persuasion, especially when addressed to those who lack the training to follow thearcane, arid argumentation relished by that tradition. The rhetorical tradition recognizes afundamental fact, namely, that people are creatures of ﬂesh and blood, of passionate desire\\nand aversion.\\n 1098237x, 2003, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.10096 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

My\\nconcern is that we come clean about this and recognize rhetoric as part of our professionalwork. As Shrag notes, rhetoric is a tradition of knowledge that has been “the most in ﬂuential\\ntradition in European and American schools since the Renaissance ”(p. 275). Once we have\\naccepted that research is about persuasion, our task as researchers and graduate supervisorsbecomes one of acknowledging the place of rhetoric in discussions of the rigor of research,because our students need to know what is rhetoric and what is not, and they need to knowwhat is poor rhetoric and what is good.\\nWe need to replace talk about reliability and validity with a concept that acknowledges\\nthat the value and purpose of research lies in human affairs. “Rigor ”seems to do this. By\\npromoting the idea of rigor and its facets, we might discourage students of research fromreliance upon checklists about reliability and validity. Part of the danger of checklists is thatthey tend to sanitize research. In contrast, the facets of rigor tell us plainly that research isvery human.\\nI am grateful to Christine Chapman and Jennifer Taylor for help with aspects of this paper.\\nREFERENCES\\nAmerican Psychological Association (APA).

In it he writes:\\nMethod means a way to a result, a means to an end, a path to a goal. Method therefore\\nvaries with the end to be reached. Without a clear notion of the end, we cannot proceed\\nintelligently upon the journey toward it. (Dewey, 1916, p. 3)\\nDewey was referring to methods of science teaching and how they are shaped by goals.\\nOne can make the analogous argument that what we are attempting to accomplish in ourresearch programs will shape the methods that we use. Thus, any attempt to narrow therange of acceptable methodologies that science education researchers use would also havethe effect of narrowing the purposes for which research can be used.\\nIwould like to use this anniversary as an opportunity to respond to some of the political\\npressures science education researchers face, particularly those in the United States, re-garding the methods they use. I want to raise the question of whether these new criteria forquality research will lead to good research. At times my discussion may seem surprisinglypolitical. To leave out the politics, however, would be to provide a distorted and incompleteanalysis. Finally I call for a more rigorous, critical dialogue within our community aboutboth methods and aims as a way to improve research in science education. I hope that thesecomments are useful not only to U. S. researchers but also to researchers across the globewho aspire to do good research.\\nNO CHILD LEFT BEHIND AND THE GOLD\\nSTANDARD IN THE UNITED STATES\\nIn 2002, the Educational Sciences Reform Act (H.R. 3801) replaced the Ofﬁce of Educa-\\ntional Research and Improvement with the Institute of Educational Sciences (IES). IES isthe research arm of the U.S. Department of Education. Its mission is very closely connectedto the implementation of No Child Left Behind (NCLB; H.R. 1).\\nOn 8 January 2002, NCLB was signed into law, requiring states to establish standards and\\nassessments in reading, math, and science. Understanding and then eliminating inequitiesin achievement is a clearly stated priority of NCLB. Although educators have known foryears about enormous inequalities in our education system, NCLB makes these inequitiesfront-page news. Achievement inequities are exposed, and schools and districts are heldaccountable for them. Achievement data must be disaggregated by race/ethnicity, economic\\nC/circlecopyrt2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.2BRICKHOUSE\\nstatus, English language proﬁciency, and disability. The legislation is not consistent in terms\\nof demands for reporting by gender (Kahle, 2004). This attention to diverse groups ofstudents is also now a requirement for federally funded research.\\nAlthough NCLB was a bipartisan bill with strong congressional support, Hess and\\nMcGuinn (2002) have traced its ideological roots to Barry Goldwater conservatism that em-phasizes “individualism, self reliance, economic liberty, social mobility, and entrepreneur-ship” (Hess & McGuinn, 2002, p. 78). The idea is that every individual should havethe right to pursue his or her dreams with little or no interference (or support) from thegovernment. NCLB is a response to the criticism that there is not a level playing ﬁeldbecause so many privileged Americans (white, middle class) receive an education thatenables them to retain an unearned privilege. If we provide all children with the sameeducational opportunities andeliminate the achievement gap between children of differ-\\nent races and socioeconomic backgrounds, then laissez-faire capitalism becomes a fairgame.\\nApriority of the IES is “to develop or identify a substantial number of programs, practices,\\npolicies, and approaches that enhance academic achievement and that can be widely de-ployed” (http://www.ed.gov/about/ofﬁces/list/ies/prioritiesoutline.html). Research in medi-cine and welfare policy—areas that are deemed to have made great progress throughresearch—are examples for us to follow (http://www.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/rigorousevid/guide\\npg3.html#purpose%20and%20executive%20summary). The upshot of this\\nis that research projects seeking federal funding will be judged against the gold standard:randomized ﬁeld trials with valid control groups and quantiﬁcation of outcomes. Imple-mentation of NCLB requires knowledge of this sort.\\nAgreat deal has already been written about these criteria for quality in educational\\nresearch. (See, for example, Teachers College Record ,vol. 7, no. 1; Qualitative Inquiry ,\\nvol. 10, no. 1; Educational Researcher ,vol. 31, no. 1; Educational Researcher ,vol. 32,\\nno. 7). Here, I will not be discussing what should count as high-quality research. InsteadIwant to address the issue of how to do good research in an age of NCLB. The intent of\\nthe gold standard is to improve the quality of education research. But will this lead to goodresearch?\\nGOOD RESEARCH\\nWhat I mean by good research is not simply research that is well done. What I mean is\\nwhether it accomplishes worthy goals for the beneﬁt of both individuals and society. Follow-ing Hostetler (2005), I frame this as an ethical question rather than merely a methodologicalone.\\nWhat might it mean to do good research in science education? Here are some candidate\\nstandards:\\n1. Evaluation of learning speaks to important educational aims for science education.\\n2. There is a careful and honest description of who is and who is not beneﬁting in\\nscience education studies.\\n3. There is potential for inﬂuencing policy and practice.\\nWhile this is certainly not an exhaustive list of good standards, let us take it as a beginning\\nand consider whether NCLB and the gold standard support or constrain these good standardsfor research.\\n 1098237x, 2006, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20128 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The value of science for them resides in the added meaning it gives to the usualoccurrences of their everyday surroundings and occupations. (Dewey, 1916, p. 8)\\nEducational aims in science education are strongly inﬂuenced by our visions of what\\nwe consider an educated person to be. They are also shaped by what kind of science andsociety we desire. A society in which science operates relatively autonomously from societyrequires little in the way of scientiﬁc literacy. Science education in such a society need serveonly as a conduit for those who seek entry into professional science. Scholars in scienceeducation, who view science as an integral part of a democracy, have argued for a conceptionof science education that empowers the public to interact with science intelligently (Rudolph,2005). To these scholars, science is not an unmitigated good. Scientiﬁc institutions mustbe held accountable to the good of the larger society, and individuals must be enabledto read and reason well about science and technology in their everyday walking-aroundlives. Contemporary democracies depend on an educated citizenry that can make reasoneddecisions about the products of the sciences and can inﬂuence the sciences in productiveways (Brickhouse, 1994). These aims of science education must be the subject of critical\\ninquiry, for they have as much inﬂuence on the nature of the science curriculum as doempirical results regarding student learning.\\nAlthough scholars in science education have frequently addressed and often disagree on\\nexactly what we ought to aim for in science education, there is almost certainly consensus\\nthat what is learned in school science must have some applicability beyond school. In otherwords, the purpose of science education is not merely to generate good test scores. The\\nrelationship between science test scores and the aim of science education described aboveis tenuous at best. We could conceivably raise test scores in science without substantivelyinﬂuencing who engages in science either professionally or as a citizen or enhancing thequality of that engagement. Tests are only a proxy for those competencies that we reallyvalue. Some tests are certainly better proxies than others. But none of them arethe actual\\ncompetences that are the aim of scientiﬁc literacy. While there may be times when it isjustiﬁable to use test scores as a proxy for the competence we value, we need to be verycritical of our measures and cognizant of the need to keep real educational assessment asclose to the actual competence as we can. This, of course, presents serious challenges forthe drive toward standardization and quantiﬁcation in NCLB and the gold standard, sincethe more complex competences are also the most difﬁcult to measure.\\nAlthough the legislation describing the gold standard includes the requirement that re-\\nsearch address signiﬁcant learning outcomes, it is impossible to know what this means,if anything. The kind of speciﬁcity that accompanies the description of what constitutesscientiﬁcally based research is absent in addressing what counts as a signiﬁcant learningoutcome. One could argue, for example, that certain relatively simple skills that are easilymeasured are prerequisite to more complex learning outcomes and are therefore signiﬁ-cant. (This argument is now prevalent in models of reading that assert that decoding is aprerequisite to comprehending text.)\\nGold standard research on student learning cannot avoid judgments regarding signif-\\nicance. Embedded in any assessment of student learning are values regarding what is\\n 1098237x, 2006, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20128 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

For example, for Morris Shamos, scientiﬁc literacy is taken to be an un-\\nderstanding of science as scientists know it (Shamos, 1995). If your conception of scientiﬁcliteracy is that individuals should be able to read and critically assess scientiﬁc texts, thenyour assessment will look very different from the former. Which assessment you choosewill to a great extent determine which program will produce stronger learning outcomes.Gold standard research might tell us that program A is better than program B based on ahighly reliable test. The research, however, could fail to be good because the knowledge thatis gained in the program is of little value to anyone in their everyday walking-around lives.Much of the substantive disagreement in science education is over value-laden notions ofwhat it is about science that students should learn—a struggle that is not unique to scienceeducation (e.g., see Hiebert, 1999) and that has been pervasive throughout the history ofeducation (Lagemann, 2000).\\nPerhaps the biggest struggle in science education in U.S. schools today is over the teaching\\nof evolution by natural selection. Advocates of a notion of intelligent design are arguingfor its inclusion in the science curriculum. One could carry out gold standard research onthe learning of intelligent design. If this learning does not, however, provide individualswith access to scientiﬁc institutions or help them develop competence in dealing with thescience in their everyday walking-around lives, then it is not good research.\\nThere Is a Careful and Honest Description of Who Is and\\nWho Is Not Benefiting in Science Education Studies\\nResearchers often study particular teaching approaches and measure students’ achieve-\\nment outcomes that are then turned into means. Alternatively, researchers may describetypical student learning outcomes to understand overall impact. I would argue, however,that good research also attends to those who do not become engaged in our science educationprograms or who do not acquire the competencies we value. Relying on overall averages ortypicality can mask the differential effects a particular intervention may have on childrenof diverse linguistic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.\\nNCLB and the gold standard could encourage researchers to be more accountable for how\\ninterventions affect the diverse populations of children because they require disaggregatingdata in ways that would make it difﬁcult to hide differential impact behind averages. I confessthat I am skeptical that eliminating the achievement gap (as determined by test scores alone)will make much difference in the ways in which people from diverse backgrounds engagein science. The tests that are used by NCLB, such as the National Assessment of EducationProgress (NAEP), seem to me to be poor proxies for scientiﬁc competence. Nevertheless,conventional measures of achievement do provide access to additional education, includinghigher education.\\n1Researchers can utilize a variety of methods for understanding how\\ninterventions affect children from diverse backgrounds—and attending to these differenceswould make our research better.\\nThere Is Potential for Influencing Policy and Practice\\nWhile academic science educators ought to have the same freedom as other scholars to\\npursue research that may have no immediate application, a higher ethical standard is thatresearch should have at least some potential to improve the quality of education and thelives of children.\\n1Thanks to Okhee Lee for reminding me to consider this.\\n 1098237x, 2006, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20128 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

In other words,educational “research” has been “upgraded” to educational “science,” and in exchangefor adopting the methods of the sciences, we are promoted out of anonymity into greatervisibility and potential for inﬂuencing educational policy and practice. The goal of theEducational Sciences Reform Act of 2002 is to make education an evidence-based ﬁeld inwhich research is consulted in making programmatic decisions. As science becomes a part ofthe accountability requirements in 2007, science education researchers may ﬁnd increasingopportunities to work on projects with outcomes that could shape science teaching andlearning in schools.\\nAt the same time that there could be new opportunities for science educators, there is also\\ngood reason for great caution. It would be very easy for science educators to ﬁnd themselvescaught up in the effort to raise achievement, yet to forget the limits of their own methods ofassessment. We could ﬁnd ourselves promoting interventions that raise test scores yet saylittle about students’ competence to engage in science in authentic ways. They may becomegood at doing school science but remain incapable of doing anything of value in scienceand science-related communities outside of school. It would be irresponsible for scienceeducators to participate in creating illusions of equity that have little meaning in terms ofstudents’ abilities to engage in scientiﬁc competencies that really matter.\\nThe struggle for research to be framed and used to beneﬁt practice has a long history\\n(Lagemann, 2000). For universities to produce research, and for those research results tothen be applied to practice, is a strategy that frequently has been tried and consistently hasfailed. More contemporary models, including those supported by funding agencies, look\\nfor researchers to form partnerships with schools and districts in order to avoid the hazardsof application. Also, there is a great deal of interest in studying the scale-up process; infact, many of the research programs funded by the IES examine scaling up of educational\\nprograms. However, there are many problems of policy that research alone cannot answerdirectly. Even research with straightforward experimental results does not necessarily pro-vide a clear recommendation for action (Norris, Phillips, & Macnab, 2005). A seeminglystraightforward problem such as which of two science curricula to implement is as much astruggle over the values inherent in the programs as it is with what evidence can be generatedregarding student learning.\\nWhile we should aim to create such partnerships, this requires that practitioners be well\\nversed in educational research. Unfortunately, U.S. federal policy regarding the preparation\\nof teachers is moving against us on this matter. Certiﬁcation to teach science increasinglyrequires little more than a bachelor’s degree in a science. More and more new teachers havelittle or no exposure to educational research as they now almost completely bypass schoolsof education on their way to being christened certiﬁed and/or highly qualiﬁed (Windschitl,2005).\\nFinally, the timing of our “promotion” to a science is an interesting one. We are told that if\\nwe act like scientists by adopting methods from the natural sciences, our recommendationswill matter. Yet this is not what has happened with the science that was conducted on theeffectiveness of sex education programs and the cessation of HIV infections. Our federalpolicy continues to support abstinence-only programs in spite of the evidence (Bruckner&Bearman, 2005) and conclusions supported by the American Psychological Associa-\\ntion (http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html) that they are less effective than morecomprehensive sex education programs. Furthermore, this reformation to be more like thebiological sciences is occurring at the same time that evolution by natural selection is nottaken seriously both at the highest levels of government and in the population at large asbeing the theory of consensus that drives biological research. While it seems that pushing\\n 1098237x, 2006, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20128 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

They may also push educators to attend to learning differences in the populationsin which we work. They are not, however, a guarantee for good research. In some respects,for example, by the relatively narrow focus on achievement as deﬁned by test scores, thegold standard could distract us from good research.\\nMy discussion here has been largely centered on whether the gold standard will lead\\nto good research at the individual project level. There is also a very important questionregarding whether the gold standard will improve science education research as a ﬁeld.\\nGold standard research can be an important tool for educational researchers when it is\\none of an array of methodological choices. There are good reasons to believe that method-ological diversity is an asset to educational research rather than a liability. Methodologicaldiversity allows us to address a far greater range of questions than would be the case if wewere to develop a methodological orthodoxy. While we, as a research community, shouldattend carefully to methodological issues to be sure that the research we do is of the highestpossible quality, we should also continue to critically evaluate considerations that are ethicaland normative in character. This will not be achieved with narrow, a priori standards forresearchers. If we want to improve science education research, what is required is open andeducative dialogue. Pamela Moss (2005), drawing on Gadamer’s philosophical hermeneu-tics, has articulated what it might mean for educational researchers to converse with oneanother in ways that improve our understandings.\\n2She articulates differences between re-\\nsearch programs as an asset to the ﬁeld because it is through dialogue across differencesthat we are enabled to improve our own understandings. The value of Moss’s articulationis that she argues not for compromise but for real understanding of diversity. We should bemodest in our claims and generous in our interpretations of the work of others. Even if wedo not agree with others’ conclusions, we should try to understand their assumptions andhow they could have come to those conclusions. But most importantly, we are obligatedto read the work of others in ways that “illuminate the weaknesses” (p. 270) in our ownperspective.\\nScience Education has been and will continue to be a place where methodological and\\nepistemological diversity is valued. We want to be a journal where you will ﬁnd articlesthat will inform and enrich your thinking. On our 90th anniversary, I would like to extend aspecial invitation for our readers to do two things: 1) Read an article in this issue that is notlike anything you would write. Try to interpret it in ways that inform your own ideas. 2) Ifthis leads to signiﬁcant new insights that might be of interest to others, use our Commentsand Criticism section as a way to write about these ideas and better promote the kind ofdialogue that will push us as a research community to improve the work we do.\\n2Special thanks to Donna Alvermann for sharing this paper with me and others at the Gold Standard(s)\\nfor Research in Science Literacy Conference, Victoria, Canada, Oct. 2005.\\n 1098237x, 2006, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20128 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Perhaps your own child is one of herstudents. If you could be a ﬂy on the wall as this novice educator begins her ﬁrst months ofteaching, what would you expect to see?\\n•Does she explore with her students the “big ideas” worth learning in science andavoid spending time on trivia?\\n•Can she effectively diagnose the pre-existing conceptual understandings of her stu-\\ndents and use this information to make strategic adjustments to instruction?\\n•Can she mentor students through investigations in ways that allow them to eventuallybecome independent problem-solvers?\\n•Does she employ a variety of group-learning strategies depending on the goals of theclass?\\n•Is she aware of the range of ways children might demonstrate their understandingsof science?\\nThis daunting list could be distilled down to a single question: “Does she have the\\nskills to help all children learn science meaningfully?” The answer to this question maybe determined by whether she has completed a rigorous program of teacher preparation---astepping-stone into the profession traditionally controlled through schools of education. Isay “ may be determined” because serious questions have emerged over the past few years\\nabout whether the research communities that study teacher development have generatedareliable evidentiary base about the inﬂuence of preparation programs on the eventual\\npractice of their graduates and the learning of their students. This issue has been fuelinganationwide debate about how teachers should be prepared, and for a number of states,\\nthe time for talk is already over. With the support of the federal government, most statesare experimenting with alternative ways of placing teachers in classrooms, some of whichseem like little more than background checks for relevant content knowledge.\\nAt the national level, the Institute of Educational Sciences (the research arm of the U.S.\\nDepartment of Education) has contracted with the National Research Council to undertakeastudy of the evidence supporting various aspects of teacher preparation. This study will\\nsynthesize available research on the academic preparation and educational characteristicsof candidates in both traditional and alternative certiﬁcation programs. The aim of thiscongressionally mandated effort is to assess the content of preparation programs and the\\nC/circlecopyrt2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.526 WINDSCHITL\\ndegree to which these programs are based on converging avenues of scientiﬁc evidence.\\nSome policymakers are eager for studies like these to contribute to a kind of “FlexnerReport” for teacher preparation. The Flexner study was conducted in the early 20th centuryin order to move medical schools from a dependence upon anecdote and unscientiﬁc formsof evidence to practices rooted directly in the sciences (Monk, 2004). Unfortunately, thereis little of the kinds of evidence about teacher education that can be used to fashion broadprogrammatic policy and some worry that the IES report and similar synthesis studies willbe used to suggest reforms despite the lack of useful data.\\nIn this essay, my aim is to characterize this contested terrain of teacher preparation, explain\\nwhy the current debates should concern the science education community, and perhaps mostimportantly, discuss how educational researchers can help generate the types of evidenceabout teacher preparation that can be used by policymakers to guide the licensing of thoseindividuals who work directly with our children. Without empirical data to build a case forpreparing teachers to enter the science classroom, all participants in this national debate---including educational researchers---will occupy the same unsteady rhetorical ground, relyingon ideology and untested assumptions as the basis for action. Coupled with this chargeof gathering evidence is, of course, the responsibility of the teacher education researchcommunity to be as open as any other stakeholder group to evidence that disconﬁrmsclosely held beliefs about how (or whether) to prepare new science teachers to enter theprofession. Put simply, we cannot impact this debate without advancing our ﬁeld, and doingso according to the dispassionate canons of good science.\\nPATHWAYS INTO THE PROFESSION\\nIn an ideal world, teacher education programs are purposefully designed, evidence-driven\\nsystems of opportunity for aspiring educators to explore the links between productive the-ories and practices related to instruction, to develop the dispositions and skills necessaryto facilitate the learning of children from diverse backgrounds, and to be apprenticed intotheir craft under authentic conditions. The less optimistic reality however, is that manypreparation “programs,” including those for science teachers, have scaled back what appearto be crucial components of preservice experience. In fact, there are a growing number of“pathways” into the profession that allow people into classrooms without any preparationat all.\\nIn at least three states, prospective high school teachers are not required to have stud-\\nied curriculum, teaching strategies, classroom management, uses of technology, or theneeds of special education students. They essentially bypass teacher education altogether(Galley, 2004; Georgia Professional Standards Commission, 2004; Keller, 2004). Thesestates make no provisions at all for student teaching as compared with 18-week require-ments in Wisconsin and Minnesota (NASDTEC, 2000). Idaho now accepts, as the sole basis\\nof teacher certiﬁcation, successful passage of online exams administered through the feder-ally approved American Board for Certiﬁcation of Teacher Excellence (U.S. Department ofEducation, 2003). School districts all over the United States are developing state-approvedalternative routes to certiﬁcation, some of which meet or exceeded normal licensing stan-dards, while others offer only a few weeks in training that do not include learning theory,child development, or content-speciﬁc methods.\\nJudging from the retention rate of graduates from fast-track certiﬁcation programs, the\\npreparation does not seem sufﬁcient for most of them to remain in the profession morethan a couple of years. This is important because evidence from large-scale data sets onretention patterns in K-12 schools suggests that teacher shortages are caused primarilyby early attrition rather than failure to attract people into the profession in the ﬁrst place\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

Darling-Hammond and Youngs (2002) reviewed\\nthe dropout rates of some large-scale, quick certiﬁcation programs. An evaluation of theLos Angeles Teacher Trainee Program, California’s largest district-run internship program,revealed that only 80% completed the ﬁrst year of training and only 65% completed thesecond year and received credentials the year after (Wright, McKibbin, & Walton, 1987).Comparable attrition rates were found for an alternative certiﬁcation program in New YorkCity (the Teaching Fellows Program) which lost more than 15% of its ﬁrst class by midyearand more than 30% by the end of the initial year (Goodnough, 2000). A study of Teach ForAmerica recruits in Houston (Raymond, Fletcher, & Luque, 2001) shows that they wereabout as effective as other inexperienced teachers, but over the 3 years of the study from60 to 100% of individuals in various cohorts had left after their second year of teaching.\\n1,2\\nCritics of these studies note that many of these alternative route programs place new teachersin some of the most high-need schools and that the attrition rate for all teachers nationally issomewhere around 50% after 5 years. These situations, however, simply underscore the needfor better preparation, supervision, and support for allwho want to educate our children.\\nIn one of the few studies comparing the learning of students of teachers from certiﬁed\\nprograms against teachers who were undercertiﬁed, effect sizes favoring the students ofcertiﬁed teachers were substantial (Laczko-Kerr & Berliner 2002). In reading, mathematics,and language, the students of certiﬁed teachers outperformed students of undercertiﬁedteachers by about 2 months on a grade equivalence scale. Students of the undercertiﬁedteachers made about 20% less academic growth per year than did students of teachers withregular certiﬁcation.\\nAs stark as these statistics on attrition and student achievement are, bear in mind that there\\nwasatleast some training of recruits in all the fast-track programs described above, and\\nthat current proposals for licensure in some states require no training at all .There is serious\\nethical subtext associated with this state of affairs. The logic behind forgoing preparationdepends on a view of teaching as a second-class profession or a short-term public service“gig” rather than as an intellectually demanding career in which one develops as a profes-sional over years. In this simpliﬁed world, teachers are technicians who merely administercurriculum designed by others and follow set routines of instruction to unproblematicallydeliver knowledge to students---and all of what is important to know about teaching (beyondcontent knowledge) can be learned “on the job.” To support this conception of “educatoras altruistic temp worker,” one must deny that teaching is a ﬁeld of inquiry with an under-lying knowledge base and somehow ignore decades of research in learning and teaching,or at least dismiss it all as nonscientiﬁc. Policies spun from these beliefs then act as themachinery of a self-fulﬁlling prophesy. When people enter this intellectually demandingprofession without specialized knowledge or reﬂective frames of thinking, they have littlerecourse but to reproduce the patterns of instruction that they remember experiencing asstudents.\\n1Teach For America requires that their recruits commit to only two years in the schools (see http://\\nwww.teachforamerica.org/).\\n2Despite the high attrition rates of many alternative certiﬁcation programs, there are some strong exam-\\nples in existence. In a review of the literature, Darling-Hammond and Youngs (2002) conclude that amongACP’s, those with the most capable graduates were those that (1) offered university coursework (including\\nmethods) before entering the classroom, (2) provided student teaching that included intensive supervisionand assistance by both school-based mentors and university supervisors while they completed additionalcoursework needed to meet full standard state certiﬁcation requirements, and (3) conducted regular in-service classes for continued development. They also, however, caution that programs and entry pathwaysthat skirt the core features of teacher preparation produce recruits who consider themselves under prepared,are viewed as less competent by principals, are less effective with students, and have high rates of attrition.\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\n528 WINDSCHITL\\nWhat this worldview fails to recognize is that advanced conceptions of pedagogy---for ex-\\nample that student assessments can be used to diagnose one’s own teaching, or that students’existing ideas about the natural world greatly inﬂuence how they respond to instruction, or\\nthat hands-on activity is ineffective without the sense-making discourse that should accom-pany it---are not commonsense notions that one “picks up” in the ﬁrst few months in theclassroom. Rather, they are nonintuitive ways of thinking about teaching and learning; theseideas are the products of research that reconceptualizes the status quo; they are modeledand practiced in good preparation programs and reinforced during supervised ﬁeld work.\\nTomany of us in the research community, it seems a curious inversion of logic that, as we\\ncome to understand more about the complexity of thinking and action making up effectiveteaching, there are widespread efforts to curtail the preparation of individuals entering theprofession. The motivation for states to sanction such pathways is made clearer, however,when we realize the pressing teacher shortages faced in some areas. California, which has anetwork of alternative certiﬁcation programs, retains about 32,000 uncertiﬁed teachers outof a total of 300,000, and will need somewhere between 260,000 and 300,000 new teachersin the next decade due to enrollment growth and faculty attrition (Sack, 2002). To manyin the science education community, the idea of substituting written tests for academic andclinical preparation to teach young people is a blatant absurdity. But to district administratorswho must staff their classrooms, this idea is the only solution to the most persistent ofproblems, and to entrepreneurs in the testing business the prospect of thousands of teachercandidates taking online exams for licensure represents a lucrative new market. However,as mentioned earlier, putting people into classrooms without preparation creates a revolvingdoor of attrition with novice teachers constantly cycling in and out of schools, in particularthe high-poverty schools that are perennially desperate for experienced and capable faculty.\\nRegardless of one’s beliefs about what it takes to teach science, about teacher shortages,\\nor allegiances to traditional preparation programs in schools of education, the issue standsthat researchers, policymakers, and teacher educators must develop expeditious yet effectiveways of training new teachers who will remain in the profession and develop over time. For\\nthis we need evidence about how preparation experiences inﬂuence candidates’ eventual per-formances and the learning of their students. Unfortunately that evidence is in short supply.\\nTHE QUESTIONS WE NEED ANSWERS FOR\\nIn their review of research on science teacher education, Anderson and Mitchener (1994)\\nfound that “there is only a small amount of research on pre-service education” and whatdoes exist “is rather limited in scope and usefulness” (p. 28). A broader review of 57 studiesin teacher preparation in general conducted for the U.S. Department of Education (Wilson,Floden, & Ferrini-Mundy, 2001) concluded that “[t]here is no research that directly assesseswhat teachers learn in their pedagogical preparation and then evaluates the relationship ofthat pedagogical knowledge to student learning or teacher behavior” (p. 12)\\n3and add “ ...we\\n3Wilson et al. add:\\nConducting research about pedagogical preparation is complicated. One complication is\\nthat ‘pedagogical preparation’ means many things. Prospective teachers take courses ininstructional methods: sometimes those courses are subject speciﬁc, sometimes they aregeneric. They also take courses in learning theories, educational measurement and testing,and in educational psychology, sociology, and history. ...course content varies, as does\\nsequencing, so that even when courses share the same title, they can be qualitatively different(p. 12).\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nTHE FUTURE OF SCIENCE TEACHER PREPARATION 529\\nknow next to nothing about high quality teaching in subject matter courses that are part of\\nthe preparation of teachers” (p. 11). In a recent synthesis of 92 data-based studies in theWilson reports (Wilson & Floden, 2003; Wilson et al., 2001), Allen (2003) states that there is\\ninconclusive evidence or no research at all regarding characteristics of effective alternativeroutes to certiﬁcation, the effectiveness of entrance requirements, or the contribution of ﬁeldexperiences to teacher effectiveness. These reports all converge on the same conclusion for\\nteacher education researchers: We have not built a convincing case for the impact of ourownprograms.\\nMany who do research on the development of science teachers may take exception to\\nthe claim that we have no evidentiary base on preparation, citing areas of inquiry for whichwe have much data (preservice teachers’ conceptions of content, studies of pedagogicalcontent knowledge, understandings of science inquiry, use of instructional strategies duringpracticums, etc.). There are indeed many high-quality studies that have examined innovativepractices within science teacher education programs and particularly within individualcourses. But if the whole of teacher education could be considered a jigsaw puzzle, weknow a lot about the pieces and very little of the whole picture.\\nCochran-Smith (2004a) offers a framework for thinking about the research that has been\\ndone versus the kind of research that is still needed. She suggests that the current situationis the result of a transition from looking at teacher education as a “learning problem” tolooking at it as a “policy problem.” Seeing teacher education as a learning problem, as wedid from the 1980s to the early 2000s, the point of research was documenting how andwhat teachers should know about subject matter and pedagogy, how they thought, howthey learned in preservice programs and schools, and how diverse school contexts shapedtheir thinking. During this time, many studies examined teachers’ conceptual structures,attitudes, beliefs, and the reﬂexive relationship these had with actual practice. Among themost severe critiques of this body of research was that it failed to make connections betweenteachers’ knowledge and skills and the impact these had on student learning.\\nMore recently (since the late 1990s) many of the debates on preparation focused on\\nteacher education as a policy problem. Conceived this way, the goal of research is “toidentify which of the broad parameters of teacher education policy that can be controlledby institutional, state, or federal policy is most likely to have a positive effect” (Cochran-Smith, 2004a, p. 297). Much of this kind of research now focuses on institutional policies(such as entrance and course requirements or the overall structure of the program) and stateor federal policies (such as state teachers tests, entry routes to teacher education, types oflicensure) that may or may not be supported by evidence demonstrating positive outcomesfor prospective teachers and their students. This view of teacher education as a “policyproblem” has also had its critics. Kennedy (1999, p. 89) argues that aspects of teachereducation studied only from a policy perspective are “crude quantiﬁable indicators” thatcannot tease out the various inﬂuences that make up teacher preparation programs. Othershave noted that the policy lens generally cannot account for the different cultures of schoolsor for how these affect teachers’ abilities to use knowledge and local resources.\\nMost of the current studies done in teacher education are small-scale investigations that\\nhave been conducted within the context of one teacher education course or one preparationprogram. Although these studies are fundamental for theory building and also for the devel-opment of practice, they “have little or no value when teacher education is conceptualizedas a broadscale policy problem because they are not intended to establish causal relation-ships and because generalizations about the broad parameters of teacher preparation areimpossible to draw from them” (Cochran-Smith, 2004b. p. 112).\\nIn sum, what we lack are well-crafted studies that ﬁrst, take a more systemic view of\\nthe process of teacher education; second, demonstrate causal or correlational links between\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\n530 WINDSCHITL\\naspects of teacher education, eventual teaching practice, and student learning; and third,\\nprovide ﬁndings that generalize beyond local programmatic effects. These types of studiesare necessary to advance the ﬁeld of science teacher education and provide data to pol-icymakers with which they can make informed decisions (Carnegie, 2004). To be morespeciﬁc, here are four broad areas of study about which we need more data.\\n1. We need to distinguish between the relative inﬂuences of individuals’ “entry char-\\nacteristics” into a teacher education program (i.e. knowledge of content, pedagogy,epistemology, dispositions and beliefs about learners, learning, equity, etc.) and thosecharacteristics fostered by experiences in the program itself. Do preparation pro-grams actually have an impact on these factors, and if so, do they affect teachingperformance?\\n2. We need a clearer picture of which aspects of preservice experience inﬂuence eventual\\nteaching performance and how this happens. Are there critical core components thatjeopardize the quality of teaching if left out of preparation programs? Are certainaspects of preservice better incorporated into the induction year? Are there “types”of teacher candidate that fare better in particular kinds of preparation programs?\\n3. We need to know what kinds of ﬁeld experiences inﬂuence preservice teachers and\\nwhether these experiences extend beyond teaching behaviors to student learning. Weneed to understand the relative inﬂuences and interactions between teacher educationcoursework and what candidates learn from cooperating teachers.\\n4. In general, we should look at teacher education as a continuum of learning, including\\nundergraduate studies, teacher education coursework, ﬁeld work with cooperatingteachers, induction, and a career of professional development. It would be helpfulto understand the transitions between these phases and to capture more of the largercontext of teacher development with long-term studies of cohorts.\\nFrom a methodological standpoint, we need studies in the areas described above (espe-\\ncially experimental, quasi-experimental, and correlational studies) that can shed light oncausal relationships. We must be careful, however, to recognize that these methods, whichtranslate more easily into the discourse of policy, represent only a part of the spectrum ofempirical approaches that are scientiﬁcally valid. Some policymakers at the federal levelhave narrowly construed “scientiﬁc research” as randomized control group experimentaldesign. But while controlled experiments are the coin of the realm in some domains ofscience, they are often impractical and/or unreasonably expensive in many institutionalsettings; further, these methods rest on the assumption that one can control all extraneousvariables---an unlikely condition within complex social systems such as teacher preparation\\nprograms and K-12 schools.\\nThe data necessary to answer these questions are not easy to generate. Because the\\nchallenge is, in part, to look at teacher education as a system of activity, we must study\\nteacher development across multiple contexts (for example in coursework andin their ﬁeld\\npracticums andduring their induction year). To complicate matters further, the “effects”\\nwe are looking for from teacher preparation programs may not emerge until many monthsafter the learning situations that gave rise to them. A new teacher, for example, may notwant to try a challenging pedagogical approach learned in a methods class (such as project-\\nbased learning or open inquiry) until his second year as a practicing professional. Yetanother difﬁcult task will be agreeing upon outcome measures for programs---how do weconstrue “impact”? What ﬁrst comes to mind here is student achievement. This may bethe most meaningful measure of teacher effectiveness and goes a step beyond observingfor particular teaching practices, but many of us know how hard it is to measure student\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nTHE FUTURE OF SCIENCE TEACHER PREPARATION 531\\nlearning in equitable and meaningful ways. There are also a number of indirect indicators\\nof quality teacher preparation. The low-hanging fruit here is teacher retention. It is logicalto assume that the better prepared a new teacher is the more success they will have intheir practice and the longer they will remain in the profession. This retention issue isproblematic, however, because poorly trained teachers often end up in schools with difﬁcultworking conditions which, in turn, exacerbates attrition. Other indirect measures include the\\nproportion of students in the teachers’ class that go on to take advanced science coursework(adjusted for school and community context), observations of teaching practices congruentwith standards, principal ratings, and the proportion of new teachers who join professionalnetworks, seek advanced degrees, or attempt National Board Certiﬁcation.\\nTocapture the kinds of effects that resonate best with policymakers, we do need some\\nstudies that look across different preparation programs and support more robust assertionsabout particular approaches by including larger numbers of participants and/or that seekto compare across different programs. This means having teams of researchers at differentsites who can identify similar outcome measures and use common instruments for datacollection. These types of studies are complex, long term, and expensive. Perhaps this iswhy they are almost nonexistent.\\nIn the process of building a case for effective forms of teacher preparation, we must de-\\nvelop a more precise language about programs. “Teacher preparation” means many different\\nthings across the country and the same is true for “alternative” preparation programs whichvary in their content, duration, and structure. “Traditional” teacher preparation has been an\\nundergraduate model while the label “alternative” applies to such a spectrum of programsthat the term is meaningless when used to suggest the quality or length of a program. Someof these routes are “alternative” to the notion of preparation itself in that they dramaticallylower expectations for candidate’s content and pedagogical knowledge, and in many casesshift decisions about candidates’ competence to the employing school districts. Other alter-native routes include various postbaccalaureate models, such as 5th-year master’s degreeprograms that have integrated theory and skill development even more productively thanmost traditional programs. Such alternatives to the undergraduate program design typicallymeet or exceed normal licensing standards.\\nTHE CHALLENGE TO THE SCIENCE TEACHER\\nEDUCATION COMMUNITY\\nUp to this point, I have presented this challenge as one that affects all of teacher education.\\nMembers of the science education community in particular, however, have good reasons totake a leadership role in this national debate. First, it is an opportunity for us to coordinate theresearch agendas of scientists who are interested in education and those of teacher educators.More than any other school subject area, the individuals who generate the disciplinaryknowledge and teach at the undergraduate level (scientists) are also interested in teachereducation and educational research. For example, sciences faculty at many institutions teachmethods courses or content courses speciﬁcally for aspiring teachers. Colleagues in thenatural sciences have contributed much to our knowledge bases in student learning, teachercognition, content knowledge, PCK, and professional development. We stand to gain muchif we can ﬁnd empirically validated ways to link undergraduate learning with experiencesin teacher education (for instance, linking undergraduate research experiences or “nature ofscience” instruction with teacher education coursework and eventual teaching practices).Perhaps too our colleagues in the sciences can disenthrall policymakers of randomizedcontrol group experiments being the only form of viable evidence from which decisionscan be made. I am sure that astronomers, ﬁeld ecologists, and molecular biologists would\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\n532 WINDSCHITL\\nbe dismayed to ﬁnd that (according to deﬁnitions of valid research being imposed upon\\nthe work of teacher education researchers) their work would not be considered legitimate\\nscientiﬁc inquiry.\\nAsecond reason for involving the science teacher education community is that funds are\\navailable through special agencies and foundations (NSF, NIH, others) for pieces of this\\nresearch work---the kinds of funds that those in other subject matter areas (social studies,language arts, etc.) have little access to. If we wait for bodies like the U.S. Department ofEducation to support the kinds of studies that will produce meaningful data, we will beholding our collective breath indeﬁnitely.\\nThird, the K-12 science education community may be more vulnerable than other subject\\nmatter areas to a new wave of alternative route shortcuts that move people into classroomswithout proper preparation. This is because some policymakers at the highest levels nowbelieve that, since verbal ability and content knowledge correlate with good teaching, theseshould be the only qualiﬁcations for becoming a classroom teacher. The respect given tothose with scientiﬁc knowledge in this increasingly scientiﬁc and technological world maylead some to believe that having knowledge at the level of a bachelor’s degree will sufﬁceto teach in a 10th-grade classroom and that people who have an undergraduate degree orhave work experience in a science or engineering ﬁeld are “smart enough” to learn the craftof teaching through on-the-job training.\\nAnother reason we are especially vulnerable to fast-track certiﬁcation solutions is the\\nnational shortage of science teachers. Only slightly less dire than the situation in mathe-matics, many districts cannot staff their science classrooms with highly qualiﬁed facultyand for many schools it is preferable to bring in “ﬂash-certiﬁed” teachers regardless of theirpreparation rather than have an unlicensed pedestrian working with their children.\\nAﬁnal reason that science teacher educators should play a lead role in this research is\\nthat the discipline of science is built upon the principles of empirical inquiry. It would bedisingenuous for those of us whose work is based upon respect for evidence and argumentto design and teach in programs for science teachers that are based on intuition, tradition,convenience, or ideology. We should seek out and respond to the empirical evidence aboutteacher preparation as religiously as we do in the various domains of natural science.\\nSUMMARY\\nMy arguments in this essay are not meant to suggest some failure of imagination on the\\npart of science teacher education researchers or that good research is not being done, nordo I mean that certain types of research are inherently more valuable than others (imaginewhere we would be without in-depth case studies, ethnographies, historical research, andcurriculum analysis).\\n4What I do suggest is that, in important ways, decisions about the\\nlarger programmatic dimensions of teacher education are not being advanced by the fullrange of potential evidence grounded in teacher performance and student learning, leavingus vulnerable to well-deserved criticism and the very real proposition of have teacherpreparation farmed out to the free market and overtaken by those who know little aboutteaching and learning.\\nNot all high quality research has direct implication for practice or “speaks” to policy-\\nmakers in unequivocal terms, but we do need more research on teacher education thataccomplishes just these ends. Policymakers are interested in very reasonable questions thatcan be simply phrased but are immensely complex to answer:\\n4Weshould bear in mind also that science education itself is a young ﬁeld of inquiry, and we are still\\ntrying to understand how students learn while we address this teacher preparation situation.\\n 1098237x, 2005, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20090 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

It is, rather, a quest to ﬁnd multiple\\nmodels that are designed based on outcomes of high-quality teaching, student learning,and retention in the profession. Even if we can muster the collective will and resourcesto do the kinds of research we need, we should not be under the illusion that policy willalways respond to good scientiﬁc evidence; other forces are always at work to inﬂuencethe educational future of this country. But if we do not deﬁne for ourselves what it meansfor students to learn, “what counts” as good teaching, and how aspiring educators becomeprofessionals, if we cannot make empirically grounded, convincing connections amongthese phenomena, then we will have ensured for ourselves a hard-won obscurity in thepublic discourse over teacher quality.\\nREFERENCES\\nAllen, M.

Science Education\\npublished the ﬁrst scholarly papers on the sociology of science and science education.\\nRecently, it has provided a vibrant forum for research on argumentation and scientiﬁc\\ndiscourse, drawing from such ﬁelds as rhetoric, epistemology, and cognitive sciences. Aseducational research moves to more nuanced understandings of science teaching and learn-\\ning, we believe we can both learn from science studies and provide evidence relevant to\\nthe “blind spot” of science studies—education.

How do such norms translate to classroom sciencelearning environments?\\n•AI questions: What logical and other formal reasoning capabilities and patternsunderlie domain-speciﬁc inquiry in science and scientiﬁc thinking? Are there generalpatterns of reasoning that are valuable across all scientiﬁc domains?\\n•Political questions: How do we implement the theoretically best educational practicesinto the very constrained real world of science education?\\nManuscripts for this special issue should be submitted online.

Examples of science studies’ disci-plines include history of science, sociology of science, anthropological studies of science,\\nphilosophy of science, and cognitive/psychological/AI studies of scientiﬁc reasoning. The\\noldest of the science study disciplines is philosophy of science, dating back to antiquity.History of science was established in the academy at the beginning of the 20th century, with\\nsociology of science not far behind. Cognitive science and AI emerged at the beginning\\nof the second half of the 20th century, with anthropology of science being the most nascentof the group. Like science itself, the initial forays were mainly taken individually without\\nthe beneﬁt of journals, conferences, associations, or specialized educational programs.\\nThe 20th century saw the institutionalization of the science studies subjects with some\\nattempts to join them in centers and programs for the history and philosophy of science.\\nPrior to 1960, history of science was divided into two types: internal and external. Internal\\nScience Education DOI 10.1002/sce\\n 1098237x, 2006, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20187 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\\nSCIENCE STUDIES AND SCIENCE EDUCA TION 963\\nhistories of science were concerned with the concepts and logic of theories; external histories\\nwere concerned with the broader institutional, cultural, and technological inﬂuences, such\\nas the differences in the acceptance of Newtonian theory in England and France or the roleof science societies in the advancement of science. Prior to 1960 the philosophy of science\\nwith its emphasis on logic and language was almost exclusively internal.\\nUnder the inﬂuence of Kuhn’s Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions and similar research\\nsuch as that by Norwood Hanson, Michael Polanyi, Stephen Toulmin, Robert Merton,\\nLudwig Fleck, and Ernst Nagel, among others, the assumption that internal and external\\naccounts could be pursued independently was rejected. Kuhn’s work encouraged other\\ndisciplines to take science itself as a subject, and psychology, anthropology, and economics\\nof science all were born. The “internal” study of science assumed that the development ofscience could be studied as a purely logical enterprise without consideration of such factors\\nas the nature of the human mind or the availability of social networks, of social norms,\\nof competitive and cooperative motivations, of social rewards and risks, of informationnetworks, or of the ﬁnancial support for the process. In the last several decades these factors\\nhave been studied, and while most research tends to focus on one or two dimensions, fruitful\\ninteractions are increasingly common.\\nJust as internal history and philosophy of science had a narrow focus on the logic of\\nscientiﬁc processes, research shows that science education has had and continues to have\\na similar narrow focus on logical and conceptual elements. Science studies now recognizethat scientists do not just collect data, they design experiments to collect the data and they\\nreﬁne and interpret both the data and experiments. In each case what they could do and\\nwhat they actually do are inﬂuenced by their motivations, by the social, informational,and technological resources available, and by the available alternative theories and models.\\nScientists also write, read, and argue about data, models, theories, and explanations, and in\\neach case there are social and cultural contexts that inﬂuence their interpretations or their\\nchoice of statements.\\nStudents also learn and do science within contexts that include all of these factors.\\nIgnoring these factors does not make them irrelevant; it means only that science education\\nhas been blind to them. Our goal is to broaden the range of issues, interpretative frameworks,\\nand methodological orientations relevant to the production of knowledge in educationalsettings. Establishing a new section of the journal will create a forum for the exchange of\\nscholarly ideas and research results on Science Studies and Science Education.\\nGiven the current focus on domain-speciﬁc inquiry in science education, it becomes\\nimperative to achieve a fuller comprehension of the nature of reasoning in various disciplines\\nand subdisciplines. Further, there is a need for deeper understanding of the epistemic,\\nmaterial, linguistic, communicative, and representational practices in these areas. Anotherimportant area of needed scholarship is the rich science/society interactions continually\\noccurring and how these ongoing practices are situated in broader social, intellectual,\\npolitical, and economic contexts. Work with and within these domains could contributesigniﬁcantly to understanding science, thus informing educators as they help students and\\nthe public to understand and critique scientiﬁc knowledge and knowledge about science.\\nAnother viable area of research concerns the place of activities related to science educa-\\ntion in Western society and how it compares with the place of science in other cultural and\\ntechnological contexts. This focus would include manuscripts addressing the present-daypolitics of science and science education and the public’s engagement in matters of science\\neducation and policy making. Decisions here are important because they depend on whether\\nwe are considering education related to the reproduction of disciplinary practices (technicalmastery) or education aimed at a more general, citizen level of understanding. And then\\nthere is the need to consider at what level (e.g., elementary to postgraduate) and in which\\nScience Education DOI 10.1002/sce\\n 1098237x, 2006, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.20187 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The journal began as a quarterly publication entitled\\nGeneral Science Quarterly, and it was the very ﬁrst journal devoted to science education.\\nJohn Dewey wrote the inaugural essay in which he described a theme that would resonate\\nin the pages of this journal for years to come—that is the need for educational practices\\nthat target both the production of scientists AND an informed citizenry. As he described in\\na reﬂection on this original essay:\\nFor the many who are not going to become specialists in science [the] value of science\\nresides in the added meaning it gives to the usual occurrences of their everyday surroundings\\nand occupations . . . . without understanding, how can we hope to act with intelligence?\\n(Dewey, 1945, p. 120)\\nThis understanding of science, Dewey argued, could be achieved only through the explo-\\nration of everyday materials with students to better understand more fundamental scientiﬁc\\nconcepts. His short essay pushed back against simplistic, superﬁcial science curriculum\\nthat emphasized acquisition of facts — characteristics he observed in the science teaching\\nof the time. He advocated a different approach to science education, one that used everyday\\nmaterials such as “varnish or cleansers, or bleachers, or a gasoline engine” as a way of\\n“getting at some process of nature’s activity .... B u t [ t h e t eacher] never for a moment\\nallows . . . . that thing to become the end of study ....t h em a t e r i a li ss i m p l yam eans, a tool,\\na road. It is a way of getting as some process of nature’s activity ....w h i c hw h e ng r a s p e d\\nwill make them more signiﬁcant and more intelligible” (Dewey, 1916, p. 121). Here we\\nnotice his nuanced claim that concrete experiences are essential but not the endpoint of\\nscience experiences.\\nMOVING FORWARD\\nA century after his essay John Dewey’s words continue to guide the Science Education\\ncommunity. Researchers’ work should not rest at a superﬁcial level such as identifying a\\nproblem in learning or describing the inﬂuence of a new instructional tool. Rather, when we\\nC/circlecopyrt2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.788 SOUTHERLAND AND SETTLAGE\\nare at our best, science education researchers in this community use the everyday of science\\nteaching and learning (i.e., girls’ orientation to physics instruction or teachers’ approach\\nto a new curriculum) as vehicles for the identiﬁcation and explication more fundamental\\nstructure at play (i.e., classroom power relations or the interaction of educational policy,context and curriculum). Following Dewey’s admission, our work should provide a way of\\n“getting at some process” related to fundamental aspects of science teaching and learning.\\nAs the two of us settle into the editor chair of Science Education , like the editors before\\nus, we will judge the success of our efforts by whether the articles appearing in the journal\\nare “credible and signiﬁcant” (Brickhouse, 2003, p. 1). Too, like the preceding 11 editors,our shared ambition is for the work published here to continue challenging and extending\\nour community’s knowledge. Within Science Education , we seek to serve as the premiere\\nforum for examining fundamental processes shaping the teaching and learning of scienceacross the globe. Toward these ends, we embrace a wide range of methodological and\\nepistemological approaches, investigations framed by a variety of theoretical perspectives,\\nand carried out with a diverse array of settings and participants. This diversity is nicelyexempliﬁed in the manuscripts that appear in the latest issue.\\nTHE LATEST ISSUE\\nWithin this issue of Science Education , a diverse set of science education researchers\\nsituate their studies and interventions within experientially-rich activities. Below we illus-\\ntrate how these individually developed pieces of research are uniﬁed in their attention to\\nprinciples fostered by John Dewey’s inaugural Science Education essay.\\nMichael Hast studied the reasoning by different ages of London children in an effort to\\nuncover commonsense theories for explaining objects’ motion under varying conditions. In\\nhis article, Hast reinforces the goals of supporting learners to both differentiate knowledgetypes as well as to integrate phenomena into uniﬁed concepts. Merethe Frøyland, Kari\\nBeate Remmen, & Gard Ove Sørvik considered the inﬂuence of instructional practices on\\nstudents’ capacities to develop scientiﬁc observations during a rock identiﬁcation exercise.Both of these research studies drew upon Jean Piaget to inform their studies — evidence that\\nScience Education aligns to ongoing discourse about science teaching and learning. These\\nstudies substantiate the need to support children as they are observing and noticing evenas the studies made use of sophisticated methodologies ranging from statistical analyses to\\nhead-mounted video cameras. Thus, these researchers extended the ﬁeld by grounding their\\nwork in ongoing puzzles about science cognition and do so using tools almost unimaginable\\na century ago.\\nJohn Falk and a score of fellow researchers around the world took pains to remind\\nus that formal instruction is not the sole source of science education knowledge, skills or\\ndispositions. In addition, learning in and of itself, is not spatially or temporally bounded:\\n“Learning in general, and science learning in particular, is rarely, if ever, immediate. Mostindividuals develop interest, understanding, and an identity related to science through an\\naccumulation of experiences from different sources at different times.” Their study of adults\\nacross a dozen nations explored whether the “dosage” of science experiences was connectedto science outcomes. They documented that frequent, extended, and recent visits to science\\ncenters correlated to several science and technology behaviors and beliefs. Meaning-making\\nin science is not the exclusive purview of teachers within classrooms.\\nPer Anderhag with several Swedish colleagues used Dewey’s ideas of attention and\\ninterest in science to interrogate a common belief among science educators. This article\\nbegins with the tantalizing phrase “we open up the possibility that studying how ...” –\\nwhich is perhaps the ideal sentence starter for any research report. In this study, the old\\nScience Education, Vol. 100, No. 5, pp. 787–790 (2016)\\n 1098237x, 2016, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sce.21253 by University Of Illinois At Urbana Champaign, Wiley Online Library on [06/04/2023].

The objects of interest\\nwere the materials used by children during scientiﬁc investigations. The students’ interests\\nwere inﬂuenced by teachers who supported the advancement of the appreciation of theobjects’ cognitive and aesthetic properties. Essentially, among older students they had to\\ndevelop a more sophisticated perceptions of objects as being worthy of interest. Interest\\nwas not lost as schoolchildren advanced through their education but instead progressed to\\nrequire different relationships between learner and material.\\nAlexandra Schindel Dimick also considered students’ science interest but rather than of\\nclassroom science materials, this work focused on urban settings by following a teacher and\\nhis students as they restored local parks. The author highlights the unrealized potential of\\ncities in fostering students’ science interest, a setting largely neglected in most discussionabout place-based education. Dimick advances “re-inhabitation” as a concept participating\\nyouth develop as a consequence of immersion in ﬁeld activities. While deeper connections\\nto nature and history arose among the students, there remains untapped potential shouldteachers and their curriculum more deliberately developing critical consciousness.\\nTwo of the articles appearing in this volume stand out, in part, due to the role of technology\\nin their investigations. Michael Tscholl & Robb Lindgren describe children playing and\\ntalking with their parents as they engage in immersive digital simulations. Speciﬁcally, this\\nstudy identiﬁes varying talk moves by parents as their children use their bodies to launch\\nvirtual asteroids at targets. Nele Kampa & Olaf K ¨oller investigated standardized large-\\nscale assessments by relying on test responses by thousands of adolescents (the Stanford-\\nBinet test of IQs, ﬁrst published in 1916). Another futuristic advance in this study were\\nsophisticated statistical approaches, such as latent traits, to investigate whether scientiﬁc\\nliteracy is a single construct – and found that for their sample of students, biological\\nscience literacy was composed of distinct components: content knowledge and scientiﬁcinquiry.\\nAN INVITATION\\nEchoing the request by Nancy Brickhouse (2006) in a previous editorial, we invite you\\nto look through this issue and read a manuscript that is somewhat far aﬁeld from your\\ncurrent work. It is our hope that such forays into new research methodologies, theoreticalframes, and ﬁndings could inform and hone your own ideas. This ability to learn from a\\ndiverse community is the strength of this outlet. Working with the members of the editorial\\nboard and our pool of expert reviewers, as editors we will maintain Science Education as\\na vital place for innovation and interaction. Although not formally connected to an ofﬁcial\\nassociation, we nevertheless view Science Education contributors and readers as members\\nof a dynamic academic community.

For logistical reasons, we were unable to include these in the September 2022 collection (volume 106, issue5). All authors were participants in the associated NSF ‐sponsored project Science Education Campaign for\\nResearch, Equity & Teaching (NSF #2029956).\\nJessica Thompson was the curator of the Theory work group. Her paper provides framing and commentary\\nabout these previously published papers:\\nBurgess, T., & Patterson Williams, A. (2022). Utilizing theory to elucidate the work of creating equity for\\ntransformation within the science classroom. Science Education ,c106 (5), 1071 –1083. https://doi.org/10.1002/sce.\\n21721\\nBasile, V., & Azevedo, F. S. (2022).

            "after a person completes his or her formal education. School children, for one, are exposed tomany scientiﬁc concepts and ideas during family visits to museums, zoos, and science centers,and while participating in science activities sponsored by community-based organizations such asyouth groups, community centers, and camps. Children, as well as adults, spend time at homereading science-related magazines and watching science-related television. Many educational fa-cilities such as botanical gardens and natural history museums are staffed by adult volunteers whoenjoy learning science and sharing their enthusiasm for it with others. Communities and individu-als value these kinds of experiences,supporting them through their interest and patronage.\n",

            "as it often is, as learning that happens out-of-school, we prefer to deﬁne it by its characteris-tics.

Our impression was that manyof the submitting authors were unaware of relevant social science research in related areassuch as cognitive and social psychology, linguistics and anthropology, public understandingof science research, and even science education. Awareness of research models from differenttraditions could provide a theoretical underpinning for the “informal” science learning re-search and reduce the need for recreating methodologies. The articles included in this issuewere chosen in part because they demonstrated such an awareness. \n",

Some researchers are ready to look for speciﬁc outcomes,for example, investigating recall of speciﬁc museum exhibition content.

Auden’s poem, subtitled “A Reactionary Tract for the Times,” rails against ele-ments of a mass tertiary education and celebrates both intellectual and sensual exploration.His concerns about ﬁrst-year students at Harvard, Princeton, and Yale remind me of teachereducation students who approach their programs with the view that there is a ﬁnite set of clearrules of procedure that, when followed, lead to good teaching.

Neither are students of qualitative research immune fromthe infection of checklists.

During this time, many studies examined teachers’ conceptual structures,attitudes, beliefs, and the reﬂexive relationship these had with actual practice. Among themost severe critiques of this body of research was that it failed to make connections betweenteachers’ knowledge and skills and the impact these had on student learning.\n",

Much of this kind of research now focuses on institutional policies(such as entrance and course requirements or the overall structure of the program) and stateor federal policies (such as state teachers tests, entry routes to teacher education, types oflicensure) that may or may not be supported by evidence demonstrating positive outcomesfor prospective teachers and their students. This view of teacher education as a “policyproblem” has also had its critics. Kennedy (1999, p. 89) argues that aspects of teachereducation studied only from a policy perspective are “crude quantiﬁable indicators” thatcannot tease out the various inﬂuences that make up teacher preparation programs.
