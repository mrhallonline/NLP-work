The student can�t see the teacher on the other side of the mirror, but the teacher can see the student. We wonder how something can act like a mirror and a window at the same time. We investigate the scenario using a box model that maps to the system in the video. We develop an Initial Class Consensus Model to explain the\\none-way mirror phenomenon, and we identify related phenomena that could help us explain it. We share questions about the one-way mirror, which helps us form our Driving Question Board. We brainstorm investigations and data we need to answer our questions.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-PS4-2, MS-LS1-8\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop a model to identify the important parts of the system and how those parts interact that could cause an object to look different in different light conditions.\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from observations of a phenomenon in which an object appears different depending on the light conditions within the defined system.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tSome materials can be reflective and see-through at the same time.\\n?\\tWhether the material is reflective or see-through may be related to where there is a light.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Learning Plan Snapshot\\nPart\\tDuration\\tSummary\\tSlide\\tMaterials\\n1\\t10 min\\tINTRODUCE A PUZZLING PHENOMENON\\nPlay the Music Lesson video, showing a student who can see only his reflection in a one-way mirror while the teacher on the other side can see through the one-way mirror.

If you have a larger class, you may want to build more to ensure smaller group sizes. Each box model takes approximately 20 minutes to assemble, though the first one may take longer as you learn the procedures. Once built, these models can be used in the future.\\n\\nEdit Science Classroom Norms and slide N as necessary to include the norms you want to adopt in your classroom. You will also introduce the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. Provide this as a handout for students to tape in their science notebook or post it as a classroom reference chart.\\n \\nPrepare the following spaces and charts that will be used throughout the unit:\\n?\\tDay 1: Notice and Wonder chart, Parts chart\\n?\\tDay 2: Mapping the Model to the \\tchart (on chart paper or whiteboard or project slide over whiteboard)\\n?\\tDay 3: Initial Class Consensus Model (on chart paper), Related Phenomena list\\n?\\tDay 4: Ideas for Investigations chart. Also, prior to day 4, determine where to set up the DQB so students can gather around it and use the Initial Class Consensus Model as the backdrop for the DQB.\\n\\nDay 2: Box Model Investigation\\n?\\tGroup size: This will depend on class size and the number of models you build.\\n?\\tSetup: See Box Model Assembly Instructions for building instructions. Once the models are assembled, store them in a location where students cannot see them until day 2. When you are ready for students to work with the models, arrange them around your classroom to facilitate small-group work. Have the box model setup completely assembled for today�s investigation with one-way mirror film already inserted into each box. Check batteries in the flashlights and replace if needed.\\n?\\tNotes for during the lab: The viewing holes may allow light into the box and diminish the desired effect. Dim your classroom lights to minimize this problem.\\n?\\tStorage: These box models will be used again in Lesson 2.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis first lesson elicits students� initial ideas about what causes us to see different things with the same material. The lesson is sequenced to elicit initial ideas about the conditions for sight (i.e., what we need in order to see) and the different ways light interacts with materials. Many students will be curious about how a material can act as both a mirror and a window at the same time. They will deepen their understanding of the anchoring phenomenon using a scale model to help them explain what�s happening in the real world. Their curiosities will seed initial questions and future investigations into (1) the positioning of the light in the two rooms, (2) the light�s interactions with the one-way mirror compared to a regular mirror and a regular piece of glass, and (3) the structure of the one-way mirror compared to a regular mirror and a piece of glass. Students will also (4) delve into how we see objects and how our eye processes light inputs of different intensities, or brightness.\\n\\nDay 1 refers to the material as a �mirror-window,� but starting on day 2, refer to it as a �one-way mirror� or the name you�ve adopted for it as a class (e.g., �mirdow,� �mirrindow,� or �two-way mirror�).\\n\\nThis lesson builds on a 4th-grade DCI: PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation: An object can be seen when light reflected from its surface enters the eyes. (4?PS4?2). That DCI is focused on moving students toward a �path of light� (POL) model, which traces the path of light from its source to an object and then reflecting off the object into our eyes. When this is drawn, students may use arrows that point away from the source, point away from objects that reflect the light, and point toward the eyes. In contrast, it is common for students to use a �line of sight� (LOS) model focusing on what is seen by the person, so they may use arrows pointing away from the eyes and toward the object that is seen. Some students� models may reflect ideas that are a hybrid of the two models, such as arrows pointing away from the light source and also away from the eyes. In Lessons 1 and 2, look at students� models and ask probing questions to ascertain whether your students have a 4th-grade understanding (POL) or not (LOS). Additional guidance is provided throughout these two lessons to assess their understanding and to modify instruction as needed.\\n\\nBelow are suggested verbs to use and others to avoid when describing how light interacts with a surface:\\n?\\tOK to use: shines on, reaches, travels, bounces off, goes through\\n?\\tAvoid: hits (because it implies a force)\\n\\nStudents will refine their understanding of �bounces off� and �goes through� in Lesson 3, and you will add �reflect� and �transmit� as words we earn to your Word Wall. The word �reflection� will be used by students early in their discussions of the anchoring phenomenon, likely to describe the image seen in a mirror. Because reflection is part of the 4th-grade DCI, some students may also use the term to refer to how light interacts with an object. Over the course of Lesson 1, leverage what students already know about reflection even if their ideas are incomplete. Through Lesson 3, they will refine their understanding of �reflect� and add it to the Word Wall (see Guidance for Developing your Word Wall in Teacher Edition).\\n\\nThis lesson also builds on a CCC element from 3rd-5th grade for Systems and System Models: A system can be described in terms of its components and their interactions. The lesson extends students� understanding of systems to a level consistent with 6th-8th grades on day 4, when they articulate the boundary of the system and carve out what is important to study to make sense of the phenomenon. You will add �system� to the Word Wall in Lesson 8, when it becomes a word your students have earned.\\n\\nLikewise, students will develop their understanding of modeling in this unit. The class will talk about physical models as scaled representations of a system in the real world that we can use to develop and test ideas for explaining a phenomenon. They will also name diagrammatic models on day 3 as a way to document ideas about how and why a phenomenon occurs. Through the course of the unit, students will deepen their understanding of modeling. You will add �model� to the Word Wall in Lesson 5, when it becomes a word your students have earned.\\n \\nSee the Teacher Background Knowledge and Guidance for Developing your Word Wall in the Teacher Edition for guidance on how to support students� understanding of �system� and �model� during the unit.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThe phenomenon that anchors this unit can be sufficiently explained using a ray model of light (straight lines and arrows). Students will develop a robust understanding of reflection and transmission using this model over the course of studying light. They will deepen their understanding of light absorption in subsequent units (OpenSciEd Unit 6.2: How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down? (Cup Design Unit) and OpenSciEd Unit 6.3: Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others? (Storms Unit)). It is not until 8th grade that students will transition to a wave model of light in OpenSciEd Unit 8.4: How are we connected to the patterns we see in the sky and space? (Space Unit) after having developed knowledge about waves in OpenSciEd Unit 8.2: How can a sound make something move? (Sound Unit).\\n\\nIf students do not use the words transmit or transmission in this first lesson, do not introduce them. They will be explicitly introduced in Lesson 3 and added to the Word Wall at that time.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE A PUZZLING PHENOMENON\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, computer and projector, Music Lesson video\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the anchoring phenomenon. Frame the introduction to the phenomenon by saying, I have a video with an interesting phenomenon in it that may make you wonder what\\'s happening and how it works. Let\\'s watch this video together to figure out what\\'s going on. ?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrepare science notebooks to record noticings and wonderings.? Present slide A. Have students find a new left-side page in their science notebook and draw a two-column chart to record noticings and wonderings. Tell students, As you watch the video, observe it carefully and record things you notice and wonder that could help us explain how this phenomenon works.\\n\\nWatch the mirror-window video. Play the Music Lesson video from https://youtu.be/ocs6BXQPOgg . Pause the video for students to record their ideas. Play it again if time permits. When the video concludes, give students a few minutes to add to their Notice and Wonder chart.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Community building is emphasized throughout this unit. In this lesson, it is important to encourage students to draw from their own ideas and not worry about whether their ideas or questions are right or wrong. All ideas and questions are welcome. This provides students access by supporting student engagement.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Learners: Keeping a science notebook gives students a space in which to communicate their developing understandings. Students should be encouraged to record their ideas using linguistic (e.g., written words) and\\nnon-linguistic modes (e.g., photographs, drawings, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, and measurements). This is especially important for emerging multilingual students because making connections between written words and non-linguistic representations helps them generate richer explanations of scientific phenomena.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� SHARE NOTICINGS AND WONDERINGS FROM THE VIDEO\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nInitial questions about a phenomenon are intended to clarify what information is known and not known; there are often more questions than answers when scientists begin their investigations. Develop a safe and supportive space for students� uncertainty, and focus on the need to ask\\n \\nand investigate questions that may require the entire unit to resolve. If necessary, explain that early in the question-asking stage, it is OK to not know much about the phenomenon - it is through a series of investigations that we will learn more as a class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\t� IDENTIFY PARTS AND INTERACTIONS TO DIAGRAM OUR THINKING\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: It is important to create opportunities to support student engagement in meaningful, accountable talk by utilizing socially safe activity structures. This is especially beneficial to Emerging Multilingual Learners. For this reason, partner talk or small-group talk should precede whole-class discussion whenever possible so students can share their ideas with one or two peers before �going public� with the class. During this unit, there will be instances in which students immediately engage in class discussion.\\n \\nShow students the Parts chart. Ask, If we want to explain what�s happening in the video, what are the important parts we need to include in our explanation? Have the class work together to evaluate whether a part in the video is important, not important, or not sure. Ask the following question about each part students propose to include:\\n?\\tIf the part was changed or missing, would it change the phenomenon?\\n?\\tIf so, it�s important to include.\\n?\\tIf not, it�s not important to include.\\n?\\tIf we don�t know, then we�re uncertain about it.\\n\\nAs a decision is made for each proposed part, list the part in the appropriate column of the class chart. Once the class reaches agreement, say, This is a good start to figuring out how this phenomenon works. We can add more parts later if we think we missed something important. Let�s use our list to make a diagram that helps us explain how the important parts are interacting.\\n\\nDiagram interactions between the important parts.? Choose whether you want students to use the handout, Initial diagram to explain the phenomenon, or diagram directly in their science notebook.\\n?\\tIf the handout is selected, distribute one copy to each student. Modify slide E accordingly. Ask students to check that the diagram on the handout includes all the important parts we identified. Prompt them to add important parts from the class list if the diagram is missing them.\\n?\\tIf students are to diagram in their science notebook, display slide E (as is). Ask students to write the title �Mirror-Window Diagram� and the slide�s two questions at the top of the next page in their notebook and then draw the diagram, making certain to include the important parts from the class list.\\n\\nOnce students get all the important parts into the diagram and labeled, ask them to add pictures, symbols, and words to show how the parts work and interact to answer the two questions, as their initial attempt to explain the phenomenon.?\\n\\nGive students up to 5 minutes to work individually to diagram what they think is happening. Use this diagram as a formative assessment to monitor students� initial ideas about how we see objects; specifically, the extent to which their models reflect a �line of\\nsight� or a �path of light.�\\n \\nInsert a partner talk prior to that larger discussion if you believe this would benefit your students� ability to communicate and express their ideas.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nIn Lesson 1, students use systems thinking to scaffold their initial explanations of the phenomenon. They do not name it as a �system� or call it �systems thinking� until day 4. However, you can leverage what students know about systems from previous grades (i.e., �a system can be described in terms of its components and interactions�). Use this to help them articulate the important parts and interactions from the video. You may use �parts� or �components,� whichever term makes sense to your students.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nLike �system� and �systems thinking,� the term �model� is not yet used explicitly while students are setting up their initial models for explaining the phenomenon. The reason to avoid the term right now is to give students an experience with the practice before naming it, which will happen on days 2 and 3 for different kinds of models.\\nHowever, if your students are already familiar with modeling, it is OK to use �model� at this time.\\n \\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Use this opportunity to encourage students� action and expression by using different representations - symbols, colors, words, and pictures. There will be moments throughout the unit when the class agrees on shared representations, but this is not necessary right now.\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Learners: Allow students to use the language of their choice for sharing and communicating their ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\t� COMPARE DIAGRAMS WITH A PARTNER\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Learners: In this moment, it is helpful to intentionally group emerging multilingual students with peers who know their language(s) so they can communicate their initial ideas in the language of their choice. At other times, it could be useful to group them with peers whose English language development is slightly more advanced. It is important for this grouping to be thoughtful and to vary\\n \\nthroughout the course of a unit so students benefit from working with different peers.\\n\\n\\n5\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\n \\nElicit ideas for the scale model. Display slide G. Say, I can�t make our classroom into a full-size replica of the scene in the video, but I have some scale models that we can study. Define this term by explaining that a scale model is a smaller representation of something in the real world, and that we can use it to develop and test our ideas for explaining a phenomenon. Pose the question, If we want to investigate the phenomenon using a scale model, what are the important parts we need to include in the scale model??\\n\\nListen for these suggestions:\\n?\\ttwo rooms\\n?\\tlight in one room\\n?\\tno light in the other room\\n?\\tmirror-window material in between the two rooms\\n?\\tpeople on both sides\\n\\nSay, I will get our scale models out for the next class. We�ll check them with the list we just brainstormed to make sure we have what we need.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: This subtle move to bring students into the design and use of the box model on day 2 is important. If they make suggestions that you can incorporate, modify the model where possible; drawing from student ideas in this way supports engagement by optimizing relevance.\\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n6\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: The goals in this moment are (1) to support engagement by optimizing relevance for students and (2) to have students think about how physical models can be used for\\n \\nexplaining phenomena or solving problems. Accept all examples, even if they only meet goal #1 (e.g., model cars, airplanes, or other physical replicas that are not used for explaining phenomena or solving problems).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\t� MAP THE BOX MODEL TO THE VIDEO\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nUse this opportunity to make explicit the benefits and limitations of using physical representations (i.e., scale models) for explaining phenomena in the real world.\\n\\nThis part of the box model ...\\tis like this part of the real world ...\\tbecause ...\\tand is not like it because ...\\nFlashlight\\tLight in the room\\tSource of light, shining from the top\\tDifferent way it shines around the room; more direct/less direct\\nBox with the light\\tRoom with the light\\tA room with a light Square spaces with walls\\tNot the same color walls, no door, no objects in the room\\n \\n\\nBox with no light\\tRoom with no light\\tA room that is dark Square spaces with walls\\tNot the same color walls, no door, no objects in the room\\nOne-way mirror film\\tOne-way mirror in the room\\tSee through it on one side and reflection on the other side\\tNot as large, does not have glass, not hard, the effect is not as clear or dimmer\\nViewing holes\\tThe people�s eyes or the camera filming the video\\tCan see what people in the video may see\\tViewing holes are us looking into the box and not the eye of the person\\n\\n\\n8\\t� CARRY OUT THE BOX MODEL INVESTIGATION\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: 1 box model setup, 1 picture mat set with one-way mirror film, 1 flashlight, toys\\n\\n \\nSet up the science notebook and preview the investigation procedures. Display slide J. Ask students to locate their Notice and Wonder chart in their science notebook. Direct them to draw a line under their last noticing from the video and use the remaining space in the chart to add noticings and wonderings from the Box Model Investigation.\\n\\nExplain expectations for working in groups and then arrange students in groups, each with a box model at their lab tables.\\n\\nObserve the box model from the viewing holes. Give groups up to 8 minutes to investigate the box model with the light on in Room A only. Students should look through the viewing holes in both Room A and Room B several times and record their noticings and wonderings.?\\n\\nRemove Room A. If time permits, turn on the classroom lights and prompt students to turn off the flashlight in Room A and carefully remove Room A from the model. With the classroom lights on and a darkened Room B, students should look at the one-way mirror and see themselves - the same experience the music student has. When we enclosed Room A, students had a different perspective of looking at the same thing, but through a viewing hole instead.\\n\\nHave students carefully add Room A back to the model before returning to their seats.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nCirculate among the groups to support students as they notice and wonder about the box model. In this unit, you will help your students become more intentional with the questions they ask. Now is an opportunity to formatively assess the types of questions they are asking about the phenomenon, and if the opportunity presents itself, to model how to turn a wondering from a close-ended question answered with a yes or no to an open-ended question that could be investigated. For example, a close-ended question might be: �Is it a special glass?� This could be modified to: �How is the glass made to do this?� The theme of moving from close-ended questions to open-ended questions will continue throughout the unit, and small-group time is an opportunity to support students with this practice.\\n \\n \\n\\n9\\t� SHARE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE BOX MODEL INVESTIGATION\\t12 min\\nMATERIALS: Communicating in Scientific Ways handout, science notebook, Notice and Wonder chart (prepared in advance), markers\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. Distribute a copy to each student to tape in their science notebook, or post it in the classroom as a class chart. Explain that these sentence starters are one way to help us better share our thinking during discussion.?\\n\\nShare observations from the box model using sentence starters. Point out the �Observe� sentence starters and note that students can practice using them now to discuss observations. Display slide K. For about 5-7 minutes, use the slide�s prompts to have students share out as a class what they noticed as they used the viewing holes in the box model.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Learners: Scaffolds such as sentence starters can model and facilitate oral or written language production skills such as formulating questions, hypotheses, explanations, or arguments based on evidence. Such scaffolds may be of particular benefit to help emerging multilingual students develop language skills to write or communicate their\\n \\nWhat was similar between what you saw in the video and what you saw in the box model?\\n \\nIn Room A there was a reflection like in the video. In Room B you could see through the material. One side was a mirror and one side was a window.\\n \\nideas to peers. These scaffolds are an effective approach to support all students in using tools for construction and composition of ideas on paper or through discussion (Supporting Universal Design for Learning).\\n \\nIt is important that scaffolds be used purposefully and removed when no longer needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\t� NAVIGATION\\t3 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n11\\t� FORM A SCIENTISTS CIRCLE AND DISCUSS CLASSROOM NORMS\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: Science Classroom Norms, science notebook\\n\\n \\nForm a Scientists Circle.? Ask students to assemble their chairs in a circle and to bring their science notebook and something to write with. Students will remain in the circle for the whole class period, though they will move among partner, small-group, and whole-class discussions. This will help minimize the movement of chairs during class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduce the need for norms to guide our work.Tell students, Next, we�ll try to come to agreement with all our diagrams. The purpose of introducing the consensus task before talking about classroom norms is to get students thinking about how difficult it will be to get all members of the learning community to agree and how to ensure everyone is included and heard. Point out productive behaviors you witnessed in the first two days of the lesson to communicate to students that they were already using some positive norms. Display slide N. Distribute one copy of Science Classroom Norms to each student.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Having students sit in a circle so they can see and face one another helps support engagement and build a sense of shared mission as a community of learners working together. Throughout the course of the unit, convening a Scientists Circle to take stock of what the class has figured out and where to go next will be an important tool in helping students take on greater agency in steering the direction of their learning. This circle will also help build a sense of pride in their work. You may want to inform students that professional scientists also collaborate with one another to brainstorm, discuss, and review their work.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nMany students may not know what a �norm� is, so describe norms as best practices that we all agree to work on so we have a productive and respectful learning environment. They are similar to rules but are used to guide how we work together as a\\n \\nlearning community in positive and productive ways. Students should understand how norms help everyone in the community know what is expected of them.\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL CLASS CONSENSUS MODEL\\t18 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Class Consensus Model (prepared in advance), markers\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSet the purpose for the Consensus Discussion. Display slide O. Say, The goal of this consensus discussion is to find areas of agreement and disagreement between our diagrams. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us decide how we might want to proceed in figuring out what is happening in the video. We also want to use this time to practice our norms.?\\n\\nTell students that as they listen to one another, they should evaluate their work in terms of where they have some promising ideas and where they are confused or uncertain about what is happening.?\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis discussion has two goals: (1) to continue to help students build the habit of sharing their ideas publicly and (2) to come to consensus on what we agree is happening, and more importantly, agree on where we have gaps in our understanding. Accept all responses and encourage students to share their ideas. Use probing questions to help them clearly articulate their thinking. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over another so as not implicitly communicate that one answer is more correct than another.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscuss why we see a reflection on the light side. Display slide P. Focus students on the first question. Ask at least 3 students to share their diagrams to obtain a diverse representation of ideas. Prompt the other students to look at their own diagram to compare their\\nown ideas with those being shared.\\n\\nMove the class toward representing what we think could be happening to answer the first question. Record what is and is not agreed upon for this question on the class chart.?\\n\\nDiscuss why we see through from the dark side. Repeat the same process to answer the second question. Allow at least 3 students to present their work, and then record on the class chart where the class has agreement or uncertainty and disagreement.\\n \\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: This is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to our community of learners. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that represent their current thinking and learning from their classmates, which can support their engagement if the classroom culture values diverse thinking and ideas. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together.\\n\\nUse representations like color coding and/or letter or number coding to foreground parts of the Initial Class Consensus Model. Create a key to track what colors, symbols, or letter or number codes represent different parts of the system. Although color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding ensures accessibility for any student who may be color-blind. If color coding is used, consider a color palette that uses orange, blue, black, or dark brown.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Learners: Students have likely used everyday language to describe the one-way mirror in their diagrams. Explain that it is normal to switch from everyday language to specialized language, depending on what is most useful.\\nEncourage students to use both\\ncontent-specific and everyday terms when\\n \\nexpressing their ideas. This helps students fully express themselves, allowing others to question, evaluate, and build off their ideas. Switching back and forth between different registers is especially important for emerging multilingual students because it helps them draw on their full range of meaning-making resources. Emphasize that students can choose the language that will help them most in their sensemaking.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReintroduce the concept of modeling. Once the class has created a consensus diagram, introduce students to the idea that we just developed a (diagrammatic or conceptual) model, which includes our ideas for how and why something in the world happens: In trying to explain why the music student sees only himself, but the teacher see the music student, we developed a model.\\n\\nReiterate that, Scientists use models to explain phenomena and represent their ideas in a variety of ways - in this case, we used a diagrammatic model. Remind students we also used the box model to develop and test our ideas about what was happening in the real world. Tell them this conceptual model includes our current thinking but our ideas may change over the course of the unit, so we�ll have opportunities to revise this model.?\\n\\nSlide Q is provided as an optional norms check-in moment.\\n \\nUse this moment as an opportunity to expand on the practice of modeling. Describe it as a way of making thinking visible through diagrammatic representations, physical models, or even computer models. Foreground that modeling is a verb, which indicates it�s not a �thing� but an �activity� that includes articulating, predicting, and testing ideas as we explain how or why phenomena occur. Emphasize that we use models for a purpose and that models can change as new information is learned. Avoid asking students to simply recite parts of a model as �facts�; push them to think about models as representations of ideas that can help us explain a phenomenon.\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� BRAINSTORM RELATED PHENOMENA AND ASSIGN SELF-DOCUMENTATION\\t12 min\\nMATERIALS: Related Phenomena list (prepared in advance), markers\\n\\n \\nConduct an initial brainstorm in partners or small groups. Have students remain in the Scientists Circle. Display slide R. Assign students to partners or small groups and instruct them to turn and talk about ideas for related phenomena for about 2 minutes.\\n\\nRecord a class list of related phenomena. Keep slide R displayed and ask students to share their ideas for related phenomena. Record these on the Related Phenomena list.\\n\\nConnect the chart to the Initial Class Consensus Model. Ask, Do you think our ideas so far in our class model might apply to some of these related phenomena too? Elicit a few initial ideas.\\n\\nIntroduce the self-documentation home learning assignment. Display slide S. Explain that\\nself-documentation is a way to see where these things we are talking about in class actually happen in our lives and communities.? Ask students to �photo document� or hand-draw an example of a related phenomenon they see outside of the classroom.\\n\\nPreview the logistics for how to share the photos via the class�s website, email, or airplaying them for the class, or for bringing in\\nhand-drawings. The final product from the Self-Documentation will be a collection of related phenomena posted in the classroom or digitally. Tell students to be prepared to share their self-documentation in three days.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: This home learning assignment is used to broaden students� thinking to related phenomena and leverage these everyday science experiences they have outside of school to augment the learning in the classroom. Locating the anchoring phenomenon in the context of their community makes it more personally meaningful to each student, supporting their engagement with it. It also provides students an opportunity to talk about the phenomenon with family members and other community members.\\n\\nIf your students do not feel safe completing the self-documentation in their neighborhood, have them complete the assignment around the school or their home, or look for an example that interests them online.\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n \\n14\\t� WRITE QUESTIONS FOR THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t6 min\\nMATERIALS: 2 sticky notes, marker\\n\\n \\nSet the purpose for asking questions. Tell students that all of our observations and questions so far are going to be captured today on a Driving Question Board (DQB). Say, The purpose of this work is to generate a set of questions that can guide our investigations to explain this phenomenon. To do that, we first need to brainstorm individually and write down our questions.\\n\\nDo a light pass at how to ask productive questions. Display slide T. Take a minute to review how to generate productive questions. Productive, testable questions are those that can help us deepen our understanding of how or why a phenomenon occurs.?\\n\\nWrite questions individually. Display slide U. Hand out 2 sticky notes to each student (more sticky notes if you have more time to build the DQB). Give students a few minutes to review their Notice and Wonder charts, their initial models, the Initial Class Consensus Model, and the Related Phenomena list to brainstorm questions. Ask them to use a marker to write one question per sticky note and put their initials on the back in pencil.?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nOpen-ended questions can be more productive than close-ended questions for advancing understanding of the phenomenon. An Asking Questions Tool: Open/Closed Questions is provided as a resource that you can use later in this unit and in subsequent units to help students turn close-ended questions into\\nopen-ended ones.\\n \\n\\n15\\t� DEVELOP A DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t24 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nUsing the consensus model as the backdrop of the DQB does two important things: (1) It provides a scaffold to help students make connections among their models, the phenomenon, and the questions they ask, and (2) it allows students to leverage the crosscutting concept of Systems and System Models as a lens for identifying the parts of the system where a lot of question generation happened compared to parts of the system where there may be fewer questions.\\n \\n?\\tWe will continue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n\\n  Have students share their questions. Have one student start the sharing process and continue until all questions are shared. Organize questions into categories. The questions will naturally start to cluster in groups on various parts of the model. Once students have finished sharing, ask them to look at the DQB and consider the following questions:?\\n?\\tWhat parts represented in our model, or interactions between parts, do we have a lot of questions about?\\n?\\tAre there any parts or interactions that we need to ask more questions about?\\n \\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nIt�s important to make students aware of the crosscutting concepts (CCCs) as useful lenses for studying phenomena with equal importance as disciplinary core ideas and science and engineering practices. Use this opportunity to name what students have\\n \\nASSESSMENT\\nOPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.B Ask questions that arise from observations of a phenomenon in which an object appears\\ndifferent depending on the light conditions within the defined system.\\n\\nWhat to look/listen for: All questions should be accepted at this time, but pay close attention to the types of questions your students ask.\\n\\nOpen-ended questions require a full and meaningful answer and are productive questions to prompt investigation and conversation. How and why questions are examples of this type. Students may also ask open-ended questions that are more similar to ideas for investigations (e.g., What happens if � ?). When we pursue these investigations later in the unit, students will discover new aspects of the phenomenon to be explained, motivating a need to pose new explanatory questions (how or why) about the phenomenon.\\n\\nClose-ended questions require a yes or no response or a simple, one-word answer. Sometimes close-ended questions are productive for prompting us to do an investigation (e.g., If you turned the lights off in both rooms, will both sides be able to see through?), but they do not lead to fruitful conversation.\\n\\nWhat to do: If important parts of the mirror-window model have few or no questions posted on the DQB, prompt students to generate more questions in this space so they can investigate each important part or interaction.\\n\\nAfter the DQB is built, count the number of questions (on your own, not with students) that are close-ended versus open-ended. If your students ask mostly close-ended questions, have them use the Asking Questions Tool: Open/Closed Questions when adding new questions to the DQB in later lessons. If your students asked mostly open-ended questions, shift their focus to refining their questions into testable ones using the Asking Questions Tool: Testable Questions.\\n \\nbeen doing as systems thinking, and have them reflect on when they used systems thinking in their sensemaking work.\\n \\n\\nClose-ended question\\tPossible revision to make later in the unit\\nIs there any other way to make this mirror?\\tHow is this mirror made?\\nDo you need to use a specific mirror to make this work?\\tWhy does this specific mirror work this way and other mirrors don�t work the same way?\\nDoes the lighting affect the results?\\tWhy does the lighting affect the results?\\nDoes it only work if one room is dark and the other is bright?\\tWhy does it only work when one room is dark and the other room is bright?\\nIf you turned the lights off in both rooms, will both sides be able to see through?\\tWhy would making both rooms dark affect the results?\\n\\n\\nName the boundary of the system we are investigating. Say, We�ve been using parts and interactions between parts to help us decide what is important for explaining the one-way mirror effect. How did we decide the boundary of what we need to include? Discuss the boundary concept using the prompts below.\\n\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nHow did we decide the boundary of what we need to include?\\n \\nSeems like it was all happening inside the rooms, so the walls are the boundary.\\n \\n\\n \\nHow do we know this is a good boundary to use? What do we think would happen if we didn�t have it?\\n \\nIf you opened the doors, it might change what is seen. If you took away the walls, the one-way mirror might not work.\\n \\n\\nWas there a boundary on our box model?\\tThe sides of the cardboard boxes.\\n\\n \\nDid anything cross the boundary when we investigated with the box model?\\n \\nMaybe light from the classroom when we opened the viewing holes.\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� DEVELOP IDEAS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION\\t12 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nAs students brainstorm investigations, probe their understanding of how gathering evidence will help them answer a question or set of questions. Use this information to gauge their experience with testable questions and the data necessary to answer them. Testable questions can include both experimental ones (which students will generate in Lesson 3) and non-experimental ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\t� DECIDE WHERE TO GO NEXT\\t3 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\nDecide where to go next. Use slide Y to remind students of the class�s mission: to figure out how the one-way mirror can act as both a mirror and a window at the same time. Explain that on day 2, you heard lots of suggestions for switching the light from Room A to Room B and figured this was a good starting place. Have students share their initial thinking about what they predict will happen.\\n\\nListen for suggestions such as these:\\n?\\tThe phenomenon will reverse itself.\\n?\\tThe phenomenon won�t be able to reverse itself. It�ll look different.\\n?\\tThe phenomenon may kind of reverse but not completely.\\n\\nSlide Z is an optional slide that you can use at any moment to check in on the classroom norms. Modify as necessary.\\n \\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off each other�s ideas, and it also helps to scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that are not part of topics in this unit. Over time students will get better and better at forming testable questions within the scope of the driving question. This type of activity gives them practice at doing that.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nOpenSciEd Science Classroom Norms are intended to support constructive collaboration and communication during partner, small-group, and whole-class discussion.

We develop systems models to explain what is happening in the two cups that leads one to be better than the other at maintaining the temperature of the drink. We brainstorm why certain objects are better at keeping things cold or hot by considering features of each object�s design. We ask questions about design features and other factors that influence how well an object can keep something hot or cold, and we generate a list of investigations to test these factors.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-PS1-4, MS-PS3-3, MS-PS3-4, MS-PS3-5, MS-PS4-2, MS-ETS1-4\\n\\n \\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop an initial model to describe a phenomenon in which a substance changes temperature and identify structural parts of the system that slow down or speed up the temperature change (function).\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from careful observation and can be investigated in the classroom to test how parts of the cup systems contribute to warming up or maintaining the temperature of the substance inside.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tThe cup system includes the different parts of the cup and the water and air inside the cup.

The day of the lab, make pitchers of cold water using the ice (chill to 6? or colder) so that you have 800 mL per class section (roughly 400 mL for each of the two cups). Have a pitcher of cold water, the single-wall plastic cup, the double-wall plastic cup, two thermometers, and a 500-mL beaker nearby for the demonstration.\\n?\\tNotes for during the lab: Make sure to have ice on hand if you need to make additional cold water.\\n?\\tSafety: Warn students to be careful with glass thermometers, as any breakage may cause cuts and scrapes.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nStudents encounter the anchoring phenomenon as an iced drink in a regular plastic cup watering down and warming up more quickly compared with an iced drink in a fancy plastic cup. Students develop systems models to communicate their ideas about important structural parts of the cup systems and mechanisms that can explain how and why the drink in the regular cup warms up while the drink in the fancy cup stays a little colder. The purpose of the anchor is twofold. First, it is used to probe student understanding of how something warms up or cools down and how an object�s structure could mediate this process. It leverages students� related experiences of other objects that are designed to keep things cold or hot so that students begin to identify similar structural components or processes that may be important for explaining the phenomenon. Second, the anchor allows students to ask questions they can investigate over the course of the unit to better understand how the cups and related systems work to maintain the temperature of something inside them for a longer period.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThis unit is an engineering design unit and students will complete an iterative design cycle for cups in the latter half of the unit. If the engineering design is introduced too early, students become focused on their design ideas and whether their designs work without first establishing a principled reason for developing those designs. This unit is sequenced so that students consider the designs currently used for cups and related systems before developing their own designs.\\n\\nAs students observe the Cold Cup Test on day 1, they may become immediately curious about the condensation that occurs on the outside of the regular cup. Encourage students to include in their models their ideas about how those water droplets form, but avoid spending too much time on condensation in this lesson. Prompts might include, It sounds like you think something could be leaving the inside of the cup. What are all the things that could be leaving from the inside? Students will investigate whether water leaves the inside of the cup through the wall during Lesson 5.\\n\\nAfter studying light and matter in the previous unit, students may have ideas about the transparency, reflectivity, and color of cups and related systems because they may believe light is warming the water inside the cup. These kinds of questions will naturally lead to investigations about energy transfer via radiation and how certain surfaces facilitate or slow this process. Encourage students to ask these questions if they surface, but keep in mind we will not return to these questions until later in the unit (Lessons 8 and 15).\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO THE REGULAR CUP AND FANCY CUP\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: 1 16-oz regular plastic cup, 1 16-oz fancy plastic cup\\n\\n \\nIntroduce students to the regular cup and fancy cup. Share the story about your iced drink warming up in a regular plastic cup. The story can be based on a scenario that makes sense in your context and that your students may find meaningful.? Importantly, revise slide A to match the story you want to use to situate the phenomenon.\\n\\nAsk students to turn and talk with a elbow partner for 1 minute about two questions:\\n?\\tWhy does the drink in the regular cup warm up?\\n?\\tHow could the fancy cup keep the drink from warming up?\\n\\nElicit a few initial ideas from students. Listen for these ideas:\\n?\\tThe regular cup is made of thin plastic, while the fancy cup is made of thicker plastic. Thicker is probably better.\\n?\\tThe fancy cup has more walls or layers, and that may help keep the drink cold.\\n?\\tThey are almost the same cup, so there may not be much of a difference.\\n\\nSay to students, It seems strange that the fancy cup would work so much better. The two cups seem pretty similar. Let�s test the cups and gather some data to see if the claim that the fancy cup works better is actually true.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nStudents will find the anchoring phenomenon more compelling if it is presented in a meaningful scenario rather than a contrived one. Motivate the comparison of the fancy cup and regular cup using a drink (e.g., iced water, coffee, tea, soda, or other beverage) or a local vendor that may be popular among your students. Ask the vendor to donate cups with their logo to use in your students� investigations. Most importantly, do not dwell on the set of cups presented in the anchoring scenario.\\nInstead, after day 1 move on to the suite of experiences students have had with drinks that warm up and water down quickly.\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilinguals: When adapting an anchoring phenomenon, keep in mind students� cultures and languages to make the adapted phenomena accessible to emerging multilingual students.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� BRAINSTORM HOW TO TEST THE TWO CUPS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, 1 16-oz regular plastic cup, 1 16-oz fancy plastic cup\\n\\n \\nBrainstorm how to test the two cups to evaluate the claim. Tell students to find a new page in their science notebook to brainstorm how to test the cups. Display slide B. Remind students of the claim that the fancy cup is supposed to keep a drink colder for longer than the regular cup. Ask students these questions:\\n?\\tHow could we test this claim?\\n?\\tWhat evidence could we collect to prove or disprove the claim?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGive students 1 minute to stop and jot their ideas for how to collect evidence to evaluate the claim. Have students turn and talk for another minute to share their thinking with a partner.? Then bring students back to the whole group and elicit a short list of evidence they�d want to collect.? This may include these ideas:\\n?\\tmeasuring the temperature of each drink for an amount of time\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilinguals: Before students engage in whole class discussions, it can be helpful to first provide them with the opportunity to work with others - either in pairs, triads, or small groups - on ideas related to their reasoning. These smaller group structures can be especially helpful for emerging multilingual students because they offer students a chance to engage in sensemaking with their peers, and also offers them the space to use their linguistic and nonlinguistic resources to express their ideas (and learn from other students� uses of these resources too).\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN PLANNING AND CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS\\n\\nIt is important to involve students in deciding the kinds of evidence that need to be collected to support or refute a claim (�What do we need to know?�) and in defining the strategies and/or methods used for collecting observations or data (�How will\\n \\nwe come to get the information we need?�). Students will do both of these things as they set up the Cold Cup Test. If students want to test whether the drinks water down or the ice melts, consider adding food coloring to the water in the pitcher.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\t� GATHER IN A SCIENTISTS CIRCLE FOR THE COLD CUP TEST\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: Cold Cup Test, science notebook, chart paper or whiteboard, markers\\n\\n \\nGather in a Scientists Circle and set up the Cold Cup Test. Say to students, Since we have only one set of cups, let�s form a Scientists Circle so we can all see them as we gather observations and temperature data. Bring your science notebooks with you because we have a lot of ideas already about how this could work and we need to document some of these ideas together.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN PLANNING AND CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS\\n\\nThis initial investigation should have some controls in place, but it should also reflect the real-life anchor scenario. Students will get to set up more systematic investigations where they identify independent, dependent, and control variables over the course of the unit. However, they must first recognize a need for setting up controlled experiments after they have done some �messing around� with the system.\\n \\n\\nWork together to set the test conditions.? After students are settled in place, tell them that before we test the two cups we need to think about how to make it a �fair test�. Spend about 2 minutes asking students what they think could make the test unfair and what they need to do to ensure a fair comparison between the two cups. Listen for ideas like these:\\n?\\tIf one has more ice, that could keep it colder longer.\\n?\\tIf the cups have water that is different temperatures, the one with the colder water will stay colder for longer.\\n?\\tIf one has more water, it may take longer to warm up.\\n \\nSet up the experiment using students� suggestions about what variables to control, such as the amount of water and number of ice cubes.\\n\\nSet up science notebooks together. Before you begin the test, work with students to decide how often to record a new temperature measurement, which then affects the data table�s design. Have students set up their data table just below their stop and jot, using slide C as a guide. Tell students to fill in the table based on what the class decides as the interval between each temperature reading, with the first reading at 1 minute and subsequent measurements every 8-10 minutes for about 30 minutes. Adjust slide C as necessary.\\n\\nStart the investigation of the two cups. Retrieve your pitcher of iced cold water (6? or colder), two thermometers, and a measuring cup. Pour equal amounts of water (400 mL) into each of the two cups. Place a thermometer in each cup (through the straw hole if necessary), place the lids on the cups, and wait 1 minute before taking the first temperature reading.\\n\\nTake and record the first temperature measurement. Have multiple students read the temperature in order to practice reading a thermometer and agreeing on the temperature. Direct students to record the first temperature measurement in their data table, and also to give the investigation a title, Cold Cup Test, that can be recorded in the table of contents at a later time. Set a timer for the next temperature measurement.\\n\\n\\nMake a Similar, Different, Makes Us Wonder chart. As students wait for the next temperature measurement, have them brainstorm through a discussion of what they notice is similar and different between the two cups, and what this makes them wonder about how the cups work. On chart paper or a whiteboard, draw a three-column observation table with �Similar� written atop the first column, �Different� written atop the second column, and �Makes us wonder?� atop the last column. There is no need for students to copy this table in their notebook, but have it visible to students for all of Lesson 1.\\n \\nSay to students, Until we get some data, it�s hard to tell if one is better than the other and if so, how much better. But we can start thinking about how these two cups are designed differently. All we can see right now is how they look similar or different. Let�s make some observations together of how these cups are structurally similar and different. This could give us clues about what is going on once we have some data.\\n\\nMake visual observations of the cups. After the second temperature measurement, allow students to take turns moving closer to the two cups to make observations. It is likely that students will notice condensation appear on the outside of the regular cup but not on the fancy cup. Encourage students to make a note of this observation now. Allow students to touch the cups too (note: students may want to touch something at room temperature to have a baseline for what constitutes �cool� versus room temperature). They can use this time to confirm or notice other structural similarities or differences between the cups. Consider adding these to your class chart if time permits.\\n\\nOnce all students return to their seats, allow several students to share what they observed. Listen for observations such as these:\\n?\\tThere was water on the outside of the regular cup.\\n?\\tThe fancy cup felt dry on the outside.\\n?\\tThe regular cup felt cool to touch.\\n?\\tThe fancy cup felt cool but not as cool as the regular cup.\\n\\nElicit from students a few of their experiences with drink containers, when their cups or water bottles have done similar things as the regular cup and fancy cup. Encourage students to make connections between what they are observing with the regular and fancy cups and their personal experiences with similar phenomena.\\n\\nContinue to record temperature data for at least 30 minutes even as students transition to modeling the two cups in the next activity. You can collect data beyond 30 minutes for more pronounced results. Remember to share this data with students at the start of day 2.\\n\\n\\n4\\t� DEVELOP SYSTEMS MODELS FOR THE TWO CUPS\\t12 min\\n\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper or whiteboard, markers\\nMotivate the need to diagram the two cups. Have students remain in a Scientists Circle and continue to collect temperature data. Display slide D. Remind students, When scientists are trying to understand a phenomenon, they think of it and study it in terms of systems.? They identify the important parts of the system and how those parts work together. This can give them clues about what to pay attention to and test. Let�s think of our cups as systems. We�ll call one the regular cup system and the other, the fancy cup system.\\t? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nAsk students to turn and talk to a partner, responding to the questions on the slide:\\n?\\tWhat are the parts of the cup systems?\\n?\\tWhat does each part do in the cup system?\\tThroughout the unit, the focal crosscutting concept of Systems and System Models will be used to help students generate questions about phenomena and to guide them in\\n \\n?\\tHow do the parts work together to keep a drink cold?\\n\\nLead an Initial Ideas Discussion about the parts of the cup systems.? As a whole group, generate a list of important parts of the cup systems and record on a whiteboard or chart paper. Remind students, When we are identifying important parts of the system, let�s ask ourselves what would happen if the part were not there. Would it change the outcome? If so, the part is probably important. Make a quick sketch of the important parts of the cup systems as students share each part.\\n\\n \\n\\nAs students share, probe their thinking about what each part does in the system, focusing particularly on parts that they have identified as slightly different between the two cup systems.\\n \\ndeveloping explanations. Students should build on what they learned about systems when they studied light and matter. Help students set up their initial models as systems models, identifying the important parts of each system and how those parts work together to keep a drink cold. On day 2 of this lesson, students will think about what is happening inside the cup systems and with the cups� structural parts as the drink warms up.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nIf a student says something about the double-wall cup being �airtight� or �a vacuum,� ask, Wait--you mean there is air in here? or What does �vacuum� mean? and Could there be a vacuum in here? Many students may share features of cup designs that they have heard about, but they may not know how the feature functions in the cup system. You can say things like, You think having air or a vacuum has something to do with it? Whoa--interesting. Then redirect students to focus on sketching the parts of the system, but leave the air/vacuum as a question mark for further investigation.\\n \\n\\nThere are more walls in the fancy cup, and the regular cup is just one thin wall.\\n\\nDisplay slide E. Prompt students to make similar sketches in their science notebook, now turning the sketches into models that try to explain why the drink in the regular cup warms up over time and if/how the fancy cup could slow the warming process. Remind students of the words system and model that they added to their word walls in the One-way Mirror Unit Models should\\n?\\ttry to explain what is happening that leads the drink inside to warm up or not warm up as fast and\\n?\\tuse symbols, color, and words to help communicate these ideas.\\n\\nAs students work, circulate around the classroom to make sure they are not just sketching the cups but are explaining parts of the cups that help/do not help keep the drink cold.\\n\\nAfter 5-6 minutes, say to students, Next class we will work on our models more. Think about your models tonight, and you�ll have a chance to add more details tomorrow if you think of something important you forgot to include. Let�s get a final temperature measurement and see if our data supports the claim that the fancy cup works better.\\n\\nWrap up data collection for the cup systems. Take the final temperature measurement for the cups and calculate the temperature change from the first measurement to the last. Make\\ncertain to save at least 5 minutes at the end of your class period to have a short debrief and to assign home learning. Sample data from two classrooms:\\n\\n\\tTemperature (?)\\tTemp change\\nTime\\t1 min\\t10 min\\t20 min\\t30 min\\t\\nRegular cup\\t5.5\\t6.5\\t8.0\\t9.0\\t+3.5\\nFancy cup\\t5.5\\t6.0\\t7.0\\t7.8\\t+2.3\\n \\n \\n\\n5\\t� SHARE INITIAL CONCLUSIONS AND ASSIGN HOME LEARNING\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\n \\nShare initial conclusions from the Cold Cup Test. Display slide F. Ask students to share conclusions they may want to draw from the data in response to the claim. This should be a brief sharing, as the navigation at the start of day 2 will revisit the conclusions from the Cold Cup Test. Listen for ideas such as these:\\n?\\tThe water in the fancy cup stays a little colder than the water in the regular cup.\\n?\\tThe outside of the regular cup feels wet, but the outside of the fancy cup feels mostly dry.\\n?\\tThe outside of the regular cup feels colder, so we think cold could move through the walls.\\n\\nPose the lesson question, �Why does the temperature of the liquid in some cup systems change more than in others?� Say, Sounds like we have a good start on what these two systems are about and some ideas about how each part works. Let�s come back tomorrow and see what we agree upon and where we need to investigate to learn more.\\n\\nAssign home learning to look for similar systems.? Ask students to investigate at home to find similar systems designed to maintain the temperature of something inside. The purpose is to see if related systems can help us explain how the cup system works. Students can identify systems designed to keep things cold or hot. Importantly, focus students on systems that do this without using electricity. This will help prevent them from reporting a slew of appliances, like fans, heaters, AC, oven, microwave, and so forth.\\n\\nRemind students to leave their science notebooks in the classroom so you can look at their models before the next class period.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis home learning opportunity will help students broaden their thinking to related phenomena beyond the initial two cups. Prompt students to think about other cups they use regularly at home and school, as well as related objects and systems at home that function in a similar way as the tested cups. This broadening to related phenomena will give students an opportunity to leverage their everyday, out-of-school experiences to augment their classroom learning. This should make the anchoring phenomenon more personally meaningful to each student.\\n \\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.A.1 Develop an initial model to describe a phenomenon in which a substance changes temperature and identify structural parts of the system that slow down or speed up the temperature change (function).\\n\\nWhat to look for/listen for:\\n?\\tagreement on the components of the system models (such as the walls, lids, straws, water inside, air inside between the water and the lid, and ice),\\n?\\tagreement that the structural components (parts of the cups) have some similarities (made of plastic) and differences (thin versus thick), and\\n?\\tdisagreement about how the drink inside warms up (processes or mechanisms such as heat or light going into the cup and air or cold leaving the cup). These disagreements will motivate the need for\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n6\\t� NAVIGATION\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook\\n\\n \\nReview temperature data. Display slide G. As students get settled for the class, ask them to review their temperature data and observations of the two cup systems. If you collected additional data beyond the class period, this is the opportunity to share that data with the class.\\nRemind students of the claim that the fancy cup keeps a drink colder for longer.\\n\\nPrompt students to add conclusions to their science notebook below their data table. These conclusions should reiterate the ideas briefly discussed at the end of the previous class. Look for ideas such as these:\\n?\\tThe water in the fancy cup stays a little colder than the water in the regular cup.\\n?\\tThe outside of the regular cup feels wet, but the outside of the fancy cup feels mostly dry.\\n?\\tThe outside of the regular cup feels colder, so we think cold could move between the walls, or maybe heat moves.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ARGUMENT FROM EVIDENCE\\n\\nAs students engage in this discussion, focus them on how their evidence can be useful for evaluating claims and persuading others about the validity of their ideas. When students are engaged in the work of argumentation and explanation, they should explicitly build from evidence, past experiences, and/or shared observations to support their conclusions.\\n \\n\\n\\nHave students turn and talk to discuss their conclusions with a partner. They can add new ideas to their notes if they hear something from their partner that they think is important.\\n\\nDiscuss conclusions related to the claim. Present slide H (modify to add your class� data). Have students report out to the class the conclusions they wrote in response to the claim that the fancy cup keeps the drink colder for longer. Prompt students to use the temperature data and other observational evidence (what they saw, what they felt) to support their conclusions.?\\n\\n7\\t� REVIEW NORMS AND SET EXPECTATIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge\\n \\ntogether. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\t� DEVELOP A CONSENSUS MODEL FOR THE TWO CUPS\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n \\n\\nShift the focus to explaining why the cup systems work the way they do.? Display slide J. Project the data the students collected in the previous class period. Say, We discussed conclusions we can draw from the data, and the evidence we have so far supports the claim that the fancy cup works better. Let�s see if we can explain why this is the case.\\n\\nShare cup system models with a partner. Have students work with an elbow partner to share their model. Each partner should have 1 minute to share their thinking, then they should switch so the other partner has time to share.\\n\\nTransition back to the whole group to lead a Consensus Discussion about the cup systems. Display slide K if needed. Let students know that the class is going to have a Consensus Discussion.? Tell students, The goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us figure out how we might want to proceed in figuring out why the fancy cup works better.\\n\\n\\nTell students that as they listen to one another, they should evaluate their work in terms of where their ideas are similar and seem likely to be important as well as areas where they are more uncertain. Consider using color, letter, or number coding as you build the consensus model.?\\n\\nBegin the discussion to explain why the drink warms up in the regular cup. Ask a student to volunteer their model of the regular cup for the class to consider. When the student stands up to share, they should say what they included to explain why or how the drink warms up. After\\n \\nEmphasize to students that they will use models for explaining why and how phenomena occur as they do. To be useful, models need to be �applied� to explain something, and models are most helpful when they can help us explain a lot of similar phenomena. Because students have developed only their initial models so far, they may not be able to explain a lot of the anchor phenomenon with confidence, and that is OK. Models are supposed to change as our knowledge grows, therefore students will continue to revise and edit their model over the course of the unit.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThere are two goals of this discussion: (1) to continue to help students build the habit of sharing their ideas publicly and (2) to generate a variety of ideas about what is going on with the regular cup and the fancy cup that students agree with, disagree with, or are uncertain about. It is important to accept all student responses and to encourage students to share their ideas.\\nHighlight areas of disagreement and help students clearly explicate their thinking in these areas. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over others so as not to �give away� what is actually going on in each cup system.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\nthe presentation, ask students to look at their own model and the one that was just presented to find similarities and differences between them. Ask a student with a different way of explaining to present their model. Record a consensus model on chart paper, noting what the class agrees upon and does not agree upon to explain the regular cup.\\n\\nRepeat this same process for the fancy cup. Ask for two or three new volunteers to offer up the way they explained how the fancy cup works to keep the drink from warming up as quickly. Record a consensus model of the fancy cup on the chart paper, noting areas of agreement and disagreement.\\n\\nMake certain each cup system includes the important parts agreed upon by the class, which include the cup walls, lids, straws, and water and air inside (and maybe ice).\\n\\nStep back to survey the two cup system models. Ask students, Did we account for all the important parts we agree upon? Did we explain what we know about the walls, lid, straws, water inside, and air inside??\\n\\n\\n \\nUniversal Design for Learning: Use color coding and letter or number coding to foreground parts of the model. Create a key to track what colors, symbols, and/or letters represent different parts of the system and provide students with multiple means of representation. Although color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding helps ensure accessibility for any student who may be color-blind. (See the artifact shown below for an example of color and number coding.)\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nStudents will engage in modeling to explain what caused the temperature to change inside the cups. The students will be identifying causes that are unobservable mechanisms or processes happening within the system. As students develop these models, make certain they represent the full system, including (1) structural parts of the cup (also called cup features) and (2) what is inside the cup (include the water, ice, and air). They may want to include what is outside the cup, though the air outside is a separate system that interacts with the cup system. Leverage the systems models students develop as they begin to investigate and manipulate parts of the system to figure out what causes the change in temperature of the liquid inside.\\n \\n9\\t� BRAINSTORM RELATED PHENOMENA\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Related Phenomena poster, markers\\n\\n \\nRemain in a Scientists Circle to brainstorm related phenomena. Display slide L. Using students� home learning assigned in the previous class, along with other experiences they have had, the class will develop a Related Phenomena poster to broaden this phenomenon beyond the regular and fancy cups. Guide the conversation with these questions:\\n?\\tWhat kinds of systems or objects can maintain the temperature of the stuff inside it without using electricity?\\n?\\tHow do these things work?\\n?\\tIs it the same or different depending on if cold or hot stuff is inside?\\n\\nHave students turn and talk about their ideas before sharing out with the whole group.\\n\\nDevelop the Related Phenomena poster. Sharing as a whole group, ask the students to present an experience or an object their partner or other group member shared with them. Accept all student responses and record on the Related Phenomena poster using a three-column table format (see example below).\\n\\nTry to draw out a wide variety of related phenomena. Remind students to think about objects, like the fancy cup, that do not use electricity to keep things cold or warm.\\n\\nAs students use new terms, probe what the words mean to them but avoid defining any terms in this lesson. Students will earn some of these words over the course of the unit.?\\nApply the consensus model to the related phenomena. Connect the poster to the classroom consensus model by asking these questions:\\n?\\tNow that we�ve thought about other items that do a good job maintaining the temperature of stuff inside them, are there any new things we need to track in our models?\\n?\\tDo you think our ideas in our class model for the fancy cup might apply to some of these other objects too?\\n\\nListen for students to share ideas about these characteristics of the object or system:\\n?\\tmaterial type (plastic, metal, foam)\\n?\\tthickness of the walls and lids\\n?\\tnumber of walls\\n?\\tinsulated or vacuum layers\\n?\\ttrapping and/or blocking heat or light\\n?\\tblocking cold from escaping or entering\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA key element of the Anchoring Phenomenon routine is letting students share their experiences with related phenomena. By doing this, students can connect their diverse experiences with a shared phenomenon that is the focus of the unit.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emerging Multilingual Students: When developing new vocabulary, strategies that may benefit emergent multilingual learners include using student-friendly definitions, making connections to cognate words when possible, and showing a visual representation of the word. These strategies apply to both �words we earn� and �words we encounter.�\\n \\n \\n\\n10\\t� NAVIGATION\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n \\n11\\t� CONDUCT A GALLERY WALK TO EXAMINE MODELS\\t8 min\\n\\n\\n12\\t� DEVELOP QUESTIONS FOR THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: sticky notes, markers, classroom consensus model\\n\\n \\nWrite individual questions for the DQB. Display slide O. Remind students that we want to ask how and why questions to figure out how and why the fancy cup and related systems work to maintain the temperature of the stuff inside them.\\n\\nHave students turn and talk with their partners or in small table groups to brainstorm a couple of how and why questions about the cup systems or about a pattern they observed when they looked at related phenomena.\\n\\nThen pass out one or two note cards and a marker to each student. Ask students to write one question per note card and to try to write open-ended questions to post to the DQB, though close-ended questions are also acceptable. The questions do not all have to start with\\nhow or why, but they should be questions that (1) we can answer through investigation and (2) will help us explain how these things work the way they do.?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nStudents are asking questions about phenomena that will lead to investigations, specifically on how the temperature change inside a system happens more quickly or slowly based on structural features of the system. Use these crosscutting concepts lenses to help students generate questions if they get stuck: (1) the different identified structural components and how those parts work to maintain the temperature of the substance inside (Structure and Function),\\n(2) the different parts of the system and whether anything is moving into or out of the system (Systems), and (3) patterns they identified across related phenomena that\\n \\nseem to be important in helping these objects function the way they do (Patterns).\\n\\n13\\t� DEVELOP THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: Driving Question Board\\n\\nGather in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Instruct students to bring their completed questions along with chairs to meet in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Remember that the backdrop of the DQB could be the classroom consensus model; if not, the classroom consensus model should be posted nearby and a space, such as a bulletin board, can be used for the DQB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemind students how to create the DQB (use slide P if needed):\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB, near the part of the model the question most relates to.\\n?\\tStudents should raise their hand if one of their questions relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student, who may have a related question or a new question.\\n?\\tWe will continue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n\\nStart the DQB with questions specifically about the regular cup versus the fancy cup. As students share, connect these questions to parts of the initial consensus models for the two cup systems.\\n\\nThen broaden the DQB to questions related to patterns across the different systems that are designed to keep things hot or cold. Make connections to the cups when possible.\\n \\nOrganize questions into categories. As students share, questions will naturally cluster into similar areas of the model, such as questions about the cup wall(s) and questions about the lid and/or straw. Once students have finished their sharing, ask students to look at the questions for any additional organization that can be done.\\n\\nConnect the DQB to the unit question. The question for this unit is �How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down?� Ask students if that question could work for their main DQB question posted at the top, or whether they want to modify the main question to capture all the other questions they have posted. Write/modify the agreed-upon driving question at the top of the DQB.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\n\\nBuilding towards: 1.B Ask questions that arise from careful observation and can be investigated in the classroom to test how parts of the cup systems contribute to warming up or maintaining the temperature of the substance inside.\\n\\nWhat to look for/listen for: Open- and close-ended questions.\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� PLAN IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: chart paper or whiteboard, markers\\n\\nStay in a Scientists Circle to brainstorm further investigations. Display slide Q. Have students turn and talk to a partner about ideas for future investigations to pursue. They could write these ideas in their science notebook, or if time is short, just have them spend a minute generating a couple of ideas aloud with their partner. Then ask students to share their ideas with the whole group, while you record on chart paper a list of these ideas for investigations. This Ideas for Investigations poster will remain public throughout the unit.\\n\\nTo ensure all students share their ideas, say, To make sure we have everyone�s ideas up here, I will pass a marker to the first person on the edge of the circle. The student with the marker should share one of their ideas. I will write it up and number it. That student should pass the marker to the student next to them. The second student then shares an idea, and so on. If a similar idea is on the poster already, the student should say which idea it is and how it is similar. I will then put a tally mark next to that idea.\\n\\nThe marker is passed all around the circle and all students have a chance to have their thinking represented on this poster. Offer to students that if they have additional ideas that don�t end up on the poster, they can raise their hand after we have heard once from everyone in the class (after the marker goes all the way around the circle). Emphasize to students that the Ideas for Investigations poster can change throughout the unit as they learn more. If students think of new ideas along the way, ask them to jot them down in their notebook to add to the poster later.\\n \\n15\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\nDecide where to go next. In this last activity in Lesson 1, it is important to remind students of the mission of the class and to motivate a series of investigations. Remind students that the mission of the class is to figure out (1) what causes the stuff inside the cups and related containers to warm up and (2) how the structure of those systems keeps this from happening. Say, We have accomplished so much. We now have a better idea about which parts of these systems could be really important for explaining what is happening, and you�ve come up with good questions for us to investigate. I am very excited for us to get started on investigating all of this. Seems like we need to get more data on the cup systems and then test different parts to see how important they are. Let�s try this in our next lesson.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the Driving Question Board, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off one another�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that do not lead to productive investigations. Over time students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question.

Near this space, post the classroom norms you developed with students in previous units.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nIn the first 13 lessons of this unit, students use ideas about how light interacts with matter to explain why surfaces on Earth warm up over the course of a sunny day. They will develop ideas about how the composition and spacing of molecules in the air changes as it warms and cools, which can explain what causes the amount of water vapor in the air to change, what causes water to evaporate or condense to form precipitation, what causes some air to rise or sink, and what causes clouds to form. They will develop ideas to explain how differential heating of gases and liquids results in convection, which can explain what causes some surface winds, why precipitation doesn�t fall from every cloud, and why some storms produce hail and others do not. The need to develop these ideas will be established through the development of students� questions at the end of this lesson and the investigation of these questions over the next twelve lessons.\\n\\nIn this first lesson, students identify potential causes for why hail forms, which likely include a location in the atmosphere (e.g., higher up) where the air is colder than the air near the ground. They will gather evidence for that idea in Lesson 2.\\n\\nStudents should come to this unit with prior knowledge from the Cup Design Unit related to these two NGSS performance expectations:\\n?\\tMS-PS1-4: Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure substance when thermal energy is added or removed.\\n?\\tMS-PS4-2: Develop and use a model to describe that waves are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through various materials.\\n\\nRelevant ideas from previous work include these:\\n?\\tGases, liquids, and solids are made of particles.\\n?\\tIn a liquid, the particles are constantly in contact with each other; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. In a solid, the particles are closely spaced and may vibrate in position without changing relative locations.\\n?\\tTemperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles of matter.\\n?\\tThermal energy can be transferred through particle collisions within an object or between two objects in contact with each other (via conduction).\\nStudents may come to this unit with prior knowledge that air tends to be cooler the higher up they travel, based on experiences related to mountains and air travel. Some may think that the air should get warmer higher up because it is closer to the sun.\\n\\nStudents may think that a cloud is all gas, rather than a combination of gas and droplets or crystals. Alternatively, they may think of a cloud as something similar to a sponge - a solid that can absorb only so much water before it becomes saturated and starts overflowing with water, leading to precipitation.\\n\\nIn Lesson 14 students will explore an additional anchor phenomenon, a severe winter storm forecast, to motivate adding new questions to the Driving Question Board. In the lessons that come after this, students will explain why larger-scale and longer-duration precipitation events occur by developing and using a model for how midlatitude, low-pressure weather systems form and produce precipitation, particularly along frontal boundaries.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nAn intentional effort is made in Lesson 1 to not refer to the hail events or related phenomena as �weather events.� This is to avoid having students generate questions about lightning and thunder, which will happen if the related phenomena conversation is framed too broadly. Instead, we use the terms �precipitation� and �other precipitation events� in this first lesson to help\\n \\nstudents generate relevant phenomena and questions about how precipitation forms, which is the goal of this unit. We anticipate students will generate many questions about how hail and thunderstorms form and a smaller set of questions about blizzards and hurricanes. Please avoid using the word �weather� until Lesson 2.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� EXPLORE SOME STORM-RELATED PHENOMENA\\t22 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers, computer and projector, https://youtu.be/9PeACgaLC4A, https://youtu.be/Lx4TUg3TD-s, https://youtu.be/wwPnb-1qRtQ\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the phenomenon. Say, I have some videos that show a kind of perplexing phenomenon occurring outdoors that I want to explore together. Some of you may have experienced this phenomenon before. Let�s get ready to explore this phenomenon by preparing our science notebooks.\\n\\nPresent slide A. After preparing space to organize a new section in their notebook for this unit, have students make a two-column chart on the next available page to record their noticings and wonderings from the videos.\\n\\nSay that the first video clip was recorded on April 7, 2013, in Fort Scott, Kansas. Tell them to make notes on their chart during and/or after you show the video.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShow the first hail video. Play https://youtu.be/9PeACgaLC4A . Give students an additional minute to record their notes on their charts. Take about 3 minutes to have a few students share a few of the things they noticed with the class. Start a public record of what they share, using chart paper, the board, or a digital document. Don�t worry about generating a comprehensive list when students report out what they noticed, as you can emphasize that you will ask them to report out additional noticings and wonderings again in a few minutes.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emergent multilinguals: Precipitation is a key reference word that you will use to help students think of certain kinds of related phenomena in later steps. That is why it is introduced here by the teacher, as a word that students encounter. When developing new vocabulary, strategies that may benefit emergent multilingual learners are to use student-friendly definitions, make connections to cognate words when possible, and include a visual representation of the word. Use these strategies throughout the unit for both �words we earn� and �words we encounter.�\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SCALE, PROPORTION, AND QUANTITY\\n\\nAt this point in the unit, it is important to emphasize the relatively brief duration of a typical hailstorm compared to other precipitation events students may have experienced. Helping students notice this sets the stage for thinking about\\nlonger-duration precipitation events later in this lesson and explaining them in the second half of this unit. In Lesson 2, students will see the relatively small area that a\\n \\nEmphasize that this kind of event doesn�t occur all that often, but ask for a show of hands of students who have seen something like this before. At this point, it is likely that students will identify this event as hail.\\n\\nSay, Share with your partner any experiences you�ve had with hail and how your experience compared to what you saw in the video. Give students a couple of minutes to do this.\\n\\nBring students back together, emphasizing that you have another video from a different time and place that produced different-sized pieces of hail than this one did. Tell students that this next video clip is of golf ball-sized hail that fell on October 5, 2010, in Phoenix, Arizona.\\nRemind them to record what they notice and wonder about this event during and/or after you show the video.\\n\\nShow the second hail video. Play https://youtu.be/Lx4TUg3TD-s . Give students an additional minute to record their notes. Have a few students share these with the class. Add what they share to the public record you started after the first video.\\n \\nhailstorm impacts. In the second half of the unit, they will make explicit comparisons between explanations for small-scale precipitation events (like hailstorms) vs. larger-scale precipitation events (like what is happening along frontal boundaries between mesoscale air masses).\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBefore starting the next video clip, tell students it is a time-lapse video from before, during, and after a hailstorm that produced smaller hail than the other two videos. Explain that this video was recorded on June 10, 2013, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and is sped up 60 times, so each second in the video is equal to 1 minute of real time; therefore, though the video is only 99 seconds long, it represents 99 minutes of real time.\\n\\nShow the third hail video. Play https://youtu.be/wwPnb-1qRtQ . Give students an additional minute to record what they notice and wonder. Have students share these observations with the class, and add them to your public record.\\nDon�t worry about generating a comprehensive list when students report out what they noticed. Here are some anticipated student observations:\\n?\\tIt looked like big pieces of ice or snow were falling in all the videos, but the size of them looked different in each of the three cases.\\n?\\tWhen it hit the ground, it bounced really high in the first and second videos. It made noise when it hit things in those videos.\\n?\\tThe plants in the area had green leaves (e.g., grass, flowers, trees).\\n?\\tThere was wind at some point in all of them. It was very strong in the second one (Arizona), and there was some in the first one (Kansas).\\n?\\tThere was rain at one point along with the hail in the second one (Arizona), and there was rain before the hail in the third one (Canada), and it looked like the ground was wet in the first one�-maybe from previous rain.\\n?\\tIt seemed windy in the second video. And there was a moment in the third video when the tarp on the ground seemed to flap a lot.\\n \\n?\\tIt didn�t seem to last very long in all three cases.\\n\\n\\nDefine precipitation. Once students notice that it was both raining and hailing during the second video, introduce the word precipitation as a way to refer to any liquid or solid forms of water that fall to the ground from above, which can include hail, rain, sleet, or snow. Add the word to your Word Wall along with those examples.\\n\\nIf students don�t bring up what they noticed happening in the sky before and after the hail fell in the third video, use these suggested prompts to help elicit that line of observations.\\n\\n\\nStudents may want to watch the third video again to check observations that they didn�t notice but others reported; if so, show the video again.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� CREATE INITIAL MODELS\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SCALE, PROPORTION, AND QUANTITY\\n\\nIn the next few lessons, students will uncover data that will help them determine the relative scale of this weather event. This will include how big an area hail typically falls over, how big the clouds that produce hail grow, and how fast those clouds move over an area. This initial model provides an opportunity to get a sense of students� intuitions about the height of storm clouds. Students are unlikely to indicate that they picture those clouds having started elsewhere and moved from relatively far\\n \\nabove and around the place where the precipitation fell, but an hour beforehand. The box to the right is for showing what was happening an hour afterward.\\n\\nProvide additional guidance. The handout doesn�t provide a scale for distance. Help students include their ideas about the scale in their model through prompts such as, One thing to consider in your model is how big of a space you are trying to represent. So include labels and notes to show the distance between the place where things in the air are happening and the place where the precipitation fell (How high are the clouds? How high did this precipitation fall from?).?\\n\\nLastly, remind students that even though they are drawing what was happening at different points of time in each box, they can use arrows, symbols, and annotations to connect things between the boxes, to help show how things that happened an hour in the past caused the hail to form and fall when it did.?\\n\\n\\nEmphasize that identifying what is causing the observed changes in their models can be the most challenging part, because we need to consider things that may be happening even though we can�t see them.\\n\\nWhile students construct their models, walk around the room and quietly ask probing questions of students who have no written labels or descriptions on their models, to help them represent their thinking more clearly and elaborate upon their ideas.?\\n\\nAfter giving students 8 minutes to do this, ask them to pause their individual work on this part of the model.\\n\\n \\naway (e.g., many miles) over the course of an hour.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: To support representation of ideas for students and their peers, remind students that a combination of written descriptions, labels, and diagrams helps make their thinking visible, both for themselves and for others. Ask them to write down any questions that come to mind as they work. Encourage students to use different-colored writing implements if it is helpful.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nHere are some additional prompts to help students create their initial models or make their ideas more explicit:\\n?\\tWhat did you draw in the air here? Can you label what that is? Can you explain how it got there?\\n?\\tWhere did this water come from? Can you label and explain that?\\n?\\tWhat do these lines or arrows represent? Can you label them?\\n?\\tIt looks like you included the Sun in this box. How is it connected to the changes you�re showing?\\n?\\tIt looks like you�re showing something happening in the clouds. Can you describe what you think is happening to cause that?\\n \\n?\\tHow far up do you picture this happening? Can you include a description or a scale to show that?\\n?\\tHow far away do you picture this happening an hour beforehand? Can you include a description or a scale to show that?\\n\\n3\\t� CONNECT TO PREVIOUS UNIT IDEAS\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: posters from the previous Cup Design Unit that summarize ways to represent what was happening to the matter and energy in the cup systems\\n\\n \\nConnect to ideas developed in the Cup Design Unit. Say something like, Today we explored a phenomenon where relatively big pieces of hail somehow formed and ended up falling from the sky. We also saw rain falling during the storm, and other interesting things were happening in the air, including changes in the wind and clouds overhead. So this phenomenon included things happening with both water and air. Those were two important parts of the systems we modeled and explained in our previous Cup Design Unit too. In that unit, we developed some useful ways to represent what was happening to the matter and energy in a system. Let�s review those, so we can figure out whether they might be useful in explaining changes that would cause hail to form and fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresent slide C. Give students 3 minutes to discuss these questions with a partner. Then facilitate a short Consensus Discussion around the ideas students developed in that previous unit.?\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis is considered a Consensus Discussion because the ideas being articulated were already developed in the Cup Design Unit. Since that unit would have been completed recently, reviewing\\nthese ideas should be easy. It is useful to have a public record of the ideas students are sharing to refer to throughout this lesson and later lessons. If you have these records from that unit, bring them out now. If not, develop a diagrammatic representation of the main ideas for the class to refer to. A set of sample diagrams from that unit�s teacher�s guides is provided here as a reference. Use the conventions you developed with your students for representing ideas in this discussion.\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL MODELS\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Model, Representing Particle-Level Changes in the System, colored pencil or highlighter\\n\\n \\nDevelop a particle-level representation for the initial models. Say something like, Let�s try to use those ideas about particles and energy to represent what we think is happening in the air and water above and around where the precipitation event occurred.\\n\\nPresent slide D. Distribute a copy of Representing Particle-Level Changes in the System to each student. Take a minute to review the directions and answer any questions.\\n\\nHave students complete their models on Representing Particle-Level Changes in the System and add annotations to Initial Model in a colored pencil or highlighter. During this time, walk around the room and quietly ask probing questions of students who have no written labels or descriptions representing energy on Initial Model, to help them make their thinking more visible on their papers.?\\n\\nCollect students� copies of Initial Model and Representing Particle-Level Changes in the System to review before the next period.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING ENERGY AND MATTER\\n\\nHere are some additional prompts to help students develop their initial models or make their ideas about matter and energy more explicit:\\n?\\tAre you showing the particles in a gas here or in a solid or a liquid? Or in more than one state of matter? Can you label that?\\n?\\tWhat do these arrows represent? Can you label them?\\n?\\tWhere in your model are you showing energy moving into, through, or out of the system? Can you explain the process or mechanism for how that might be happening?\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n5\\t� TARGET A NORM TO FOCUS ON\\t3 min\\n\\n\\n6\\t� COMPARE MODELS\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Consensus Model poster, markers, posters from the previous Cup Design Unit that summarize ways to represent what was happening to the matter and energy in the cup system\\n\\n \\nGather in a Scientists Circle. Present slide G. Tell students to bring their science notebooks and their handouts with them, along with chairs, to form a Scientists Circle. Move the posters from the previous Cup Design Unit to be next to the Initial Consensus Model poster.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTell students, Remember that the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement between our initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us figure out more about what might be happening in this kind of phenomenon. We also want to use this time to practice using our classroom norms.?\\n\\nRemind students of the sentence starters. Make certain a Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout is conveniently located for students to see.\\n\\nDevelop and record the consensus model. It is useful to develop a visual representation of areas of agreement and disagreement at this point. This is what you will capture in the initial consensus model, a public record of the parts or pathways of the system that students are certain about as well as those they are less certain about. A suggested plan for developing this model, along with example images showing its incremental co-construction, is provided below. Ensure that the model you develop with your students represents their shared thinking. Different classes may develop this model in a different order or way.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThere are two goals of this discussion: (1) to continue to help students build the habit of sharing their initial ideas publicly and (2) to generate a variety of initial ideas about what is causing these precipitation events. As such, it is important to accept all student responses and encourage students to share their ideas. Further, it is important to highlight any areas of disagreement and help students clearly explicate their thinking. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one\\n \\nidea over others so as not to �give away� what might be going on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n?\\tSome of us showed water going into the cloud at some point before it fell out as precipitation. Others didn�t. But, we all agree now that all that water must have gotten up into the cloud at some point.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nEmphasize that we have a way to represent temperature differences between a gas, liquid, or solid as differences in the average kinetic\\nenergy of the particles, based on our work in the Cup Design Unit. Post those representations from that unit next to this consensus model as a reference. They should include ideas identified earlier: the particles in a gas (like air) are spread far apart; the particles in a solid and a liquid are packed close together; and the particles of a substance move faster, on average, at higher temperatures and slower, on average, at lower temperatures. Ask students about any places in their model where they thought energy might be getting transferred into, through, or out of the system. Remind students that this is what they added in a new color to their original model. Areas of agreement and uncertainty will likely include these:\\n?\\tWe agree that light can be absorbed by matter (as in some systems in the Cup Design Unit), but we aren�t in agreement about whether (or where) that was happening in this system.\\n?\\tWe aren�t sure (or aren�t in agreement) whether there were other ways energy was moving through or out of the system (e.g., conduction, wind, and so forth).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n8\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n9\\t� IDENTIFY RELATED PHENOMENA AND REFLECT ON NORMS\\t7 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n10\\t� SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA AND RECORD ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers, sticky notes, Related Phenomena poster\\n\\nShare and record related experiences. Post the Related Phenomena poster. Present slide K. Take 6 minutes to have all students share out related phenomena from their notebooks and assign them to one of the two sheets on the chart.\\nStart off with the phenomenon everyone experienced�the hail events in the videos�and ask students where it should go. Students should assign it to the first poster (relatively short time). Write �The 3 hail events in the videos� on that poster.\\n\\nAs students share their examples, record them on the corresponding posters according to students� suggestions. Related phenomena that students will likely share as �short� include severe thunderstorms. Related phenomena that students will share as �longer� include things like multi-hour or -day hurricanes, northeasters, blizzards, and drizzle.\\n\\nIf students aren�t sure where an example goes, you could add it between both posters with a question mark or with arrows pointing to both posters to indicate the uncertainty. Alternatively, you could write it on another sheet of chart paper.\\n\\nWith each example shared, ask for a show of hands of students who described a similar event in their science notebooks. Put tally marks showing the number of students next to that event on the poster, and have students put a check mark next to their own similar event if it gets written up on the poster. This will ensure everyone�s example is represented on the posters and consolidate the overlapping examples. A sample poster from one class of students is shown here.\\n\\nConnect mechanisms across related phenomena. Present slide L. Give students 3 minutes to discuss the question on this slide with a partner.\\n \\n \\n\\n11\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: chart paper, scissors, markers, DQB\\n\\n \\nGather in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Present slide N. Have students bring their science notebooks and all of their sticky notes questions, including those from the last class period, along with a chair.\\n\\nRemind students that our goal is to capture all our questions to build a DQB. Say something like, It looks like you have a lot of really good questions about the hail storms in the videos and about other precipitation-related phenomena. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have similar questions. To help us group similar questions, let�s try to post each question on a spot on the Initial Consensus Model poster or on the Related Phenomena poster, or in between them.\\n\\nReview these steps for forming the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student comes up to the DQB with a sticky note, faces the class, and remains standing.\\n?\\tThe student reads their question off the note and then posts it on the DQB near the section of the consensus model or related phenomena it is most related to.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe next student reads their question and posts it on the DQB. This student also says what other posted questions it relates to and explains why or how it relates.?\\n?\\tThe student then selects the next student whose hand is raised.?\\n?\\tThis process continues until everyone has had a chance to post a question.\\n?\\tRemind students to keep track of whether their question was already asked, put a checkmark on that sticky note if it was, and then select a different question to share.\\n\\nAs students share, questions will naturally start clustering on certain parts of the DQB. An example of one such DQB is shown here.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nIf students forget to explain how or why their questions are linked to someone else�s question, press them to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off each other�s ideas, and to help scaffold student thinking. Don�t worry if some questions raised are not part of topics in this unit. Over time, with practice in this type of activity, students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the DQB.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce students have completed their sharing, ask them to identify the categories of questions, if time permits. Here are some possible examples of categories that are likely to emerge and the kinds of questions you will hear students raise related to each.\\n?\\tHail: How does hail form, why do different things (hail, snow, or rain) sometimes form in clouds, and what keeps them up there?\\n?\\tWind: Why is there a lot of wind in some storms?\\n?\\tClouds: What is going on in the clouds?\\n?\\tSnow and blizzards: Where does the water come from in a blizzard (when it seems to be freezing cold), and how do blizzards form?\\n?\\tHurricanes: What causes hurricanes?\\n?\\tRain: Why does it rain heavily sometimes in some places and not in others?\\n?\\tElevation and temperature: How does the temperature higher up in the air compare to the air closer to the ground?\\n\\nPoint out that many of the questions are connected to how and why different types and amounts of precipitation do or do not occur. Suggest that including these questions under a single driving question could remind us of how the work on any one question is in the service of all our questions. Propose that �Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others?� could be a single driving question that most of our questions could fit under.\\n\\nOnce the class agrees to this, write it in large letters on a half-piece of chart paper and hang this banner over the top of the entire DQB. Remind students that we can revise this question as we continue to figure out new things in future lessons.\\n \\nIf a question is similar to (or the same as) another one, have the student place it on top of that question so other students can visualize how many questions are identical or related. Emphasize that this provides us with evidence of where many people are thinking about similar things.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nHaving the student who volunteered and posted a question pick the next student to share (from those whose hands are raised) is a great way to turn over the pacing and cadence of this group work to the students. Reuse this technique in future Scientists Circles to encourage increased student agency in the classroom learning community. When you do this, take a seat with the students in the circle to position yourself as an equal member of the learning community who is listening, making sense of questions, and trying to figure this out. If you have questions you want to share with the group, raise your hand and wait for someone to call on you.\\n \\n12\\t� DEVELOP IDEAS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS\\t12 min\\nMATERIALS: Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need poster, markers\\n\\nBrainstorm ideas for future investigations and useful data sets. Present slide O. Read the slide aloud. Give students 3 minutes to talk with a shoulder partner to generate ideas. You may want to encourage students to stand or stretch while they talk.\\n\\nAs students are doing this, hang the Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need poster right next to the DQB.\\n\\nIn the remaining 9 minutes, have students reconvene standing in a semi-circle around the Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need poster so all can see it.\\n\\nBuild the poster with students� ideas. Tell students you want everyone�s ideas to be shared and represented on the poster. Say something like, To make sure we have your ideas up here, I will pass a marker to the first person on the edge of the circle. That student should share one idea. I will write it up and number it. Once I�ve almost finished writing it, that student should pass the marker to the student next to them. The second student then shares an idea. If that idea is on the poster already, the student should say which idea it is and how it is similar. I will put a tally mark next to it. The marker is then passed and we continue until we have heard once from everyone in the class. If you have additional ideas that don�t end up on the poster, feel free to raise your hand after the marker makes it all the way around the circle. If we run out of time, we�ll pick up here in the next class. And if you think of new ideas as we go, feel free to jot them down. We should always be thinking of ways we can add to this list.\\n\\nIn large classes, you may run out of time before all students share out an idea. If needed, resuming this activity right where you left off is a natural point to launch Lesson 2.\\n\\nA sample poster from one class of students is shown here. Notice that most of the ideas that students suggested map closely to the data presented in Lessons 2 and 3. A few additional ideas are related to cloud data and simulating a cloud, which is more aligned to the investigations in Lesson 6 and beyond. This is the typical pattern we have seen in other classrooms. Though the ideas for the investigations in Lessons 4 and 5 will not be apparent at this point, students will suggest something similar when they start those lessons, during the navigation portion.\\n\\nCelebrate the formation of a joint enterprise. Once this poster is built, celebrate that they created a joint mission and proposed action plan to guide the work of our learning community for weeks to come. Say, We have accomplished so much. We now have a mission to accomplish as a class, thanks to all the questions you shared and how you connected them. These questions really represent what we hope to figure out. And we have a lot of ideas for investigations and data sources we can work with. Let�s plan to start exploring some of this in our next lesson.\\n \\nPrioritize one set of ideas for investigations. If time permits, say something like, I noticed many of our questions were about how hail formed. Explaining that could help explain other precipitation events too. One thing you all said was weird was that it looked like the hail fell in places where green stuff was growing and it looked warm, so we weren�t sure how the water got cold enough to freeze and form hail. We wanted to know more about what it was like outside on these days when it hailed. We also thought it would be useful to look at hail more closely, for clues about how it formed. Let�s plan to look at that sort of data next time. Let�s start making some predictions beforehand. If you could take observations of both things, what do you expect you might find? Give students a minute or two to turn and talk with a partner.\\n\\nCollect students� unposted sticky note questions before they leave.\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.B Ask questions that arise from careful observation of phenomena and gaps in our current models to clarify and seek additional information about how changes to the flow of matter and energy in the air above and around a location on Earth�s surface could cause short-duration precipitation events and\\nlonger-duration precipitation events (scale).\\n\\nWhat to look/listen for:\\n?\\tClosed (yes/no) versus open (how and why) questions.\\n?\\tHail-specific questions\\n?\\tMore broad precipitation phenomena questions\\n?\\tQuestions with ideas about short versus long-term events or changes in precipitation\\n\\nWhat to do: Assess how many closed (yes/no) vs. open (how and why) questions are generated. If students are asking mostly closed questions, you can provide a copy of the questions on the DQB, and ask them to work on refining three or more of these questions so they become how and why questions that can also address parts of the original yes/no question. This could be either an in-class or home learning assignment. You will also be assessing if students generated questions that were only hail-specific or also considered precipitation-related phenomena of different durations (long and short). If students only asked questions about the hail events and not other longer-duration precipitation events, plan to revisit question generation and take additional time to have students add new questions to the DQB about other types of precipitation events they�ve experienced. These other precipitation event related questions help motivate the third and fourth lesson sets of the unit. One element of asking questions in the middle school grade band is to help students develop some questions that can be investigated within the scope of the classroom. Therefore, you may want to include opportunities for students to practice asking questions and thinking about how they might investigate them, perhaps as a recurring home learning assignment or exit or entrance ticket. For example, the following two questions could be posed at the end or start of any class period in any future lesson:\\n?\\tWhat questions were raised for us (now or at the end of the last lesson)?\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What is causing Mt. Everest and other mountains to move, grow, or shrink?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\n\\nWe read about how Mt. Everest is getting taller and moving to the northeast over time. We look at data of four other mountains and find out that they are also changing in elevation, with some shrinking. We model, at a scale larger than we can see, what we think causes a mountain to change in elevation. We brainstorm related phenomena where land near us has changed over time. This leads us to a broad set of questions that we use to form our Driving Question Board (DQB). We brainstorm possible investigations we could do and additional data sources that could help answer our questions.\\n \\n\\nlutz6078\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-ESS1-4, MS-ESS2-1, MS-ESS2-2, MS-ESS2-3\\n\\n \\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop a model showing what is happening at a scale larger than we can see (patterns) to help explain what happened to the different mountains to (cause) them to change (in elevation and/or location).\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from our analysis of information showing that Mt.

We will refer to this as the World Map. You may wish to add a title above it.\\n2.\\tInflate the 12� inflatable globe with topography representations. You will use this again in Lesson 11.\\n3.\\tLook up the location of your town and Mt. Everest, and be ready to point out these locations on the class map.\\n4.\\tIn addition, look up the distance from your school to Mt. Everest.\\n5.\\tPlace each of the Data Cards for Other Mountains and Mt. Everest in a plastic sheet protector so they can be reused between classes. Students will revisit these over the course of the unit. Additionally, use Data Cards on Other Mountains and Mt. Everest to print a black and white copy for students to annotate and place in their notebooks.\\n6.\\tA color copy of this reference can also be found in the Student Handbook.\\n7.\\tOn days 1 and 3, pairs of students will need the two squish Earth globe balls and the coffee sleeves to use as they analyze mountain data.\\n\\nYou will need a copy of the global relief map posted in a location in the room that all the students can see and gather around. This map will be used multiple times over the course of the unit. You will need two sticky notes for day 1. One should be labeled �Our School� with the distance in miles from your school to Mt. Everest. The second should be labeled �Mt. Everest.�\\nYou will need 5 large (4�x6�) sticky notes for day 2, one per mountain case.\\n\\nPrepare a space for your Word Wall that will include space for �Words We Encounter� and �Words We Earn.� �Words We Encounter� are specialized terminology we encounter in a piece of informational text that we need to know what they mean to comprehend the information. �Words We Earn� are words that we work together to make sense of over time in the context of figuring out the phenomenon. During day 1, add earthquake and magnitude under �Words We Encounter� from the reading.\\n\\nPrepare all posters using chart paper and markers:\\n?\\tDay 1 - Notice and Wonder; Initial Consensus Model for Mt. Everest chart\\n?\\tDay 3 - Initial Class Consensus for a shrinking mountain Model\\n?\\tDay 4 - Related Phenomena, Ideas for Data and Information We Need Determine where to set up the Driving Question Board prior to starting day 4.\\nAfter your last class on day 4: Organize the questions on your Driving Question Board into categories that emerge across all your classes. After (or as) you reorganize the board at the end of this lesson, make a typed record of all the questions that are on the board so that you can print them out or share with students to reference in groups during future classes. One way to do this is to take a high resolution photo of the board or transcribe the questions on the board into a digital or electronic document.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nStudents engage with the phenomenon through a headline claiming that Mt. Everest is growing and an article describing new data that has been collected collaboratively by Nepal and China. After developing an initial model representing what they think could be causing this, students analyze information about four other mountain peaks around the world to look for patterns in potential causes of changes to these landforms. The purpose of the anchor is to probe students� understanding of Earth�s geologic processes, and how those processes help shape Earth�s surface. It leverages ideas that students may have about how some changes in Earth�s surface occur gradually and are almost undetectable at a glance (i.e. the growth of a mountain), while other changes may occur suddenly and are instantly observable (i.e. earthquakes). Additionally, the anchor allows students to ask questions about a single occurrence (Mt. Everest growing in elevation) and a pattern of occurrences (other mountains also changing in elevation around the world over time), and to identify the types of data and information required to answer questions about both the specific phenomenon (Mt. Everest) and the pattern of phenomena (other mountains) they�ve observed.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nAs students share their ideas, you may hear them mention what they have heard about plates, plate tectonics, weathering and erosion. Encourage students to share their thinking, but avoid giving too much away at this point in the unit. Subsequent lessons will draw upon students� prior knowledge from earlier years and units regarding:\\n?\\tThermal energy transfer and convection to explain how Earth�s surface is in constant motion due to movement within Earth�s mantle. Students will build on their understanding of energy transfer from Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit in which they figured out energy transfers between particles, areas of high temperature have more particle motion and therefore transfer energy faster to cooler areas, and areas of higher density sink in comparison to areas of lower density (ie: less dense air masses rise while more dense air masses sink).\\n?\\tGeologic events, such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, often occur in bands along boundaries between continents and oceans.\\n?\\tWeathering and erosion as processes that help shape Earth�s surface, which helps explain how wind and water slow the effects of uplift. Explaining how landforms get taller or shorter will be the focus of lesson sets 2 and 3.\\n\\nWhile we are using the uplift rate of 2 cm, this does not reflect all forces that are contributing to the increasing elevation of the mountain range. Other forces, such as the buoyancy of the plates and isostasy are contributing to this change. These ideas are above grade band. The rate is also variable based upon these forces along with the tectonic processes continually contributing to the changing landscape, and erosional rates, which will be touched on in Lesson 13.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� EXPLORE AN INTERESTING PHENOMENA\\t4 min\\nMATERIALS: 1 Earth squish ball globe with countries labeled, 1 Earth squish ball globe with no labels, 2 paper coffee sleeves, World Map (large wall global relief map), Inflated 12� inflatable globe, 2 sticky notes (or this can be a regular sticky note cut in half)\\n\\n \\nExplore an Interesting Phenomenon. Show slide A. Say, Have you ever heard of Mt. Everest? What do you know about it? Hear from a few students about what they know about Mt. Everest.\\n\\nSay, I saw this interesting headline recently about Mt. Everest. Read the headline off the slide stating it is the tallest mountain and that it grew. Say, Turn and talk with a neighbor about what might cause a mountain to grow? Ask a few pairs to quickly share their ideas with the class.\\n\\nLocate where Mt. Everest is on a map with students. Show slide B. Bring students� attention to the global relief map, which will be referred to as the World Map with students. Say, Let�s mark on our World Map where Mt. Everest and our town/school is located. Write �Our School� on one sticky note and �Mt. Everest� on a second sticky note.\\n\\nBegin by placing a small sticky note, or half of a sticky note, labeled �Our School� to note the location of your town or school. Say, The distance from our school to Mt. Everest is \\tmiles. Let�s record that on our sticky note for our school. Prior to class, write \\tmiles from Mt. Everest on the �Our School� sticker for your location so that you are ready with this information.\\n\\nSay, Mt. Everest is located on the Asian continent between Nepal and China. Does anyone know where the Asian continent is located on the World Map?\\n\\nAsk a student volunteer to point out the location of Asia on the map. Then point out the location of the Himalayas and Mt. Everest. Place the sticky note with Mt. Everest at the location. See image to the right.\\n\\nOrient to the location on the globe.? Distribute both Earth squish ball globes and 2 coffee sleeves to each pair of students. Hold up the 12� inflated globe (or classroom globe if you have one) and instruct students to demonstrate the following with their Earth squish ball globes with their partners. As students find these locations on their small Earth squish ball globe, verify these locations using the larger inflatable globe.\\n?\\tPlace each Earth squish ball globe on its own sleeve so that the northern pole is pointed to the ceiling.\\n?\\tAsk each person to point to where we live on both Earth squish ball globes.\\n?\\tFind India.\\n?\\tLocate China and Nepal.\\n?\\tShare with students that Mt. Everest is on the border between these two countries.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: To support students in map reading during this activity section orient students to your current location on the globe as well as the United States and other notable, meaningful landmarks to students. Providing physical objects and spatial models to convey perspective can help support representation, according to the UDL framework.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� READ ABOUT MT. EVEREST\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� RECORD WHAT IS HAPPENING AT MT. EVEREST\\t6 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL MODEL\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows, Alternate: Initial Model\\n\\n \\nBrainstorm possible causes for changes in Mt. Everest. Show slide F. Say, So, we found that Mt. Everest isn�t only getting taller or increasing in elevation, but it is also moving. Let�s pause and try to picture this.\\n\\nSupport students in visualizing that the mountain is changing in multiple planes, both vertically and horizontally, by modeling these movements using your own body. For example, as you say the mountain is getting taller you could bend your knees and then �grow� your body taller by straightening your knees. To help students visualize what direction northeast is so they can think about Mt. Everest moving this way, orient them to the cardinal directions of north, east, south, west in your classroom. Then face your body towards the north and point your right arm straight out to the east. Tell students northeast would be a point in between north and east. Then turn your body and walk in a direction that is between where you are facing north and where your arm is pointing east.\\n\\nSay, Take a couple minutes with your partner and discuss your ideas for what might be causing a mountain to be changing in both of these ways:\\n?\\tPossible causes for the increase in elevation of Mt. Everest\\n?\\tPossible causes for Mt. Everest moving to the northeast\\n\\nDevelop an initial model for what is causing Mt. Everest to move and grow. Display slide G. Distribute Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows to each student. Say, We are going to take a few minutes to develop a model representing what we think could be causing these\\nchanges to Mt. Everest. What do we know is happening to Everest? Use the images on the slide as a way to capture what we have all figured out about Mt. Everest so far from the reading.\\n?\\tMt. Everest is moving about 4 cm to the northeast every year.\\n?\\tMt. Everest is growing about 2 cm each year.\\n\\nSay, As you develop your model, think about where Mt. Everest is located, as seen from a birds eye view (from above) like on the map, and think about Mt. Everest the mountain. As you develop your model of what could be causing the tallest mountain to grow and move, why might it be helpful to think about not only where the mountain is located, but also what the area around the mountain looks like from above and from the side? Sample student responses:\\n?\\tThere might be things under the mountain that are causing it to move.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Developing a model for something as large as a mountain to capture how it could be moving may be challenging for some students and they may not know where to begin. In addition, some students may benefit from seeing the location of Mt. Everest on a map as they are developing their model. Alternate: Initial Model has a mountain template from a side perspective. This handout can be used as an alternative to Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows by providing a representation that allows students access to a place to represent their ideas about how Mt. Everest is changing.\\n \\n \\n\\n5\\t� REVISIT CLASSROOM NORMS\\t3 min\\n\\n \\nRevisit classroom norms to prepare for a whole-class discussion. Show slide H. Have all students sit together in a Scientists Circle and bring their science notebooks and What is happening on Mount Everest? and Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows with them.? Have chart paper ready to develop a consensus model with the question �What is Causing Everest to Move and Grow?� at the top.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTake this opportunity to remind the class how we listen to one another, press on one another�s ideas, and ask questions of one another, and that it�s OK to disagree with ideas but it�s important to be respectful. You can use slide H to remind students of the classroom norms (if you have developed your own set of norms, replace this slide with your norms).\\n\\n\\nRemind students of the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. Direct students to the Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout. Tell students that they will be developing a consensus model together.? Ask them which sentence starters they might want to use to help them talk to one another. Examples include these:\\n\\nThink of an idea, claim, prediction, or model to explain your data and observations:\\n?\\tMy idea is �\\n?\\tI think that �\\n \\n \\n\\n6\\t� DEVELOP A CLASSROOM CONSENSUS MODEL\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Explain How Mt.

Everest to move and grow. Display slide I. Ask students to come into a Scientist\\'s Circle with their notebook, What is happening on Mount Everest?, and Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows. Say, Last class we developed our initial models for what we think could be causing Mt. Everest to move and grow. Let�s synthesize our ideas to develop a classroom consensus model. What do we know is happening to Mt. Everest from our reading that we want represented in our model?\\n\\n\\n**Note: Use the prompts below as you develop the consensus model with your students. These are suggested prompts and responses, but use whatever representations your class agrees upon to capture the changes occurring to Mt. Everest.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nAs an instructor, you have two goals for guiding the consensus discussion in addition to the goals listed on slide I. Your first goal is to help students: (1) build a positive culture where putting their ideas out in the public classroom community is valued and (2) to generate a variety of initial ideas to identify that there is a lot we don�t understand yet. Highlight any areas of disagreement. Be\\n \\nLet�s begin our class model by representing what we know from the data in the reading. What are some of the data that we want to be able to explain using our class model?\\n \\nIn 1856 Mt. Everest was 29,002 feet and in 2021 Mt. Everest was reported at 29,032 feet.\\n\\nMt. Everest has grown 30 feet since 1856. Mt. Everest grows about 2cm each year.\\nMt. Everest is moving about 4cm each year in the northeast direction.\\n \\ncareful not to favorably respond to any one idea over others as to not �give away� the answer.\\n \\n\\n \\nOkay so how should we represent that Mt. Everest has grown over time?\\n \\nMaybe we could draw a mountain with an arrow labeled with the amount of growth each year.\\n\\nYeah, or maybe we could do a before and after, like draw one mountain at 29,002 feet and then a second mountain next to it at 29,032 feet.\\n \\n\\n \\nNow that we have the growth of Mt. Everest represented, how can we add to our model to show that it moves 4 cm to the NE each year?\\n \\nWe should draw a compass rose as a key and then we could add an arrow from the bottom of the mountain to the northeast direction.\\n \\n\\nShare and record possible causes for these changes. After you have captured what changes the class knows are occurring at Mt. Everest, use the prompts below to capture representations of the mechanisms students think are causing these changes at Mt. Everest. Here you should anticipate many different mechanisms and include them all in the model with question marks next to each one once you establish that not everyone had this mechanism in their model. For each brief phrase mentioned (e.g. erosion, wind, plates, rocks pushing up, ice), it is OK to ask for clarification such as, What do you mean by that? or Do you have some way you want me to represent this to help illustrate how you picture what is causing this change? These questions can be followed up with asking students to share their reasoning behind their ideas, but don�t push on these questions at this time. The purpose here is to surface as many ideas as students have based on prior conceptions. It is important to make our thinking visible about possible mechanisms, regardless of whether they are accurate or not. One of the main goals of the unit is to figure out what mechanisms cause changes in the topography of Earth.\\n\\nSay, Okay, our model now represents what we know is happening at Mt. Everest. Let�s add what we think is causing these changes in elevation and movement.\\n\\n \\n\\nmountain, but I think they have something to do with the mountain moving.\\n\\n \\nI think we should add in wind pushing on the mountain above ground. I think this could be moving the mountain.\\n \\nHow do we want to represent this idea in our model?\\n \\n\\n \\nI think we should add in water under the mountain. There is water under the ground, so maybe there is more water near Everest making it move to the northeast.\\n \\nWhere should we include this idea in our model?\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n7\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n8\\t� COMPARE DIFFERENT MOUNTAIN PEAK INFORMATION CARDS\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: Data Cards on Other Mountains and Mt. Everest, science notebook, Data Cards for Other Mountains and Mt. Everest, 1 Earth squish ball glove with countries labeled, 1 Earth squish ball globe with no labels, 2 paper coffee sleeves\\n\\n \\nFind out more about the area where Mt. Everest is located. Show slide K. Set up a data table together with students recording it in their notebook. Tell students to open to the next blank two pages so that they have both the left and right hand side available to use. Refer to the image on the slide for an example of this.\\n\\nRemind students that the goal of our data analysis is to look for patterns in any changes in height or movement as well as any additional information that gives us ideas about possible mechanisms or causes for those changes. Ask students what kind of data we want to have to help us figure out more about how mountains change over time. When the class agrees on one type of data, students should list that on the far left column of the chart in their notebook. Some examples of types of data students may suggest the class should collect include:\\n?\\tHeight of the mountain\\n?\\tMovement of the mountain\\n?\\tChanges in height for the mountain\\n?\\tLocation of the mountain\\n?\\tEarthquake activity\\n\\nOnce the data table is set up, tell students that the information cards will probably have more information than just whether the mountains are changing. If they see something else that they think might also help explain what is happening at Mt. Everest, add a row to their data table called �other� and include that data (see example below).\\n\\nType of data\\tData\\tCauses for changes\\nHeight of mountain\\t\\t\\nMovement of the mountain\\t\\t\\nChanges in height\\t\\t\\nEarthquake activity\\t\\t\\nOther data\\t\\t\\n\\nDistribute a copy of Data Cards on Other Mountains and Mt. Everest to each student and a Mt. Everest in the Himalayas card to each group of students as reference. The Data Cards on Other Mountains and Mt. Everest reference sheet should be printed in black and white and provided\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ANALYZING AND INTERPRETING DATA\\n\\nThe mountain case cards include multiple pieces of information about the mountain peaks and the area/ranges they are part of including types of elevation changes, lateral movement that the peaks are experiencing, weather/climate, samples of rocks found in the mountain and other interesting facts.\\nThese cards will be revisited and analyzed numerous times over the course of the unit as students build their conceptual understanding of the processes causing changes to Earth�s surface. This is the first time students will begin thinking about causal and correlational relationships using data. In this first pass, students are only expected to be thinking about what causes mountains to change. But through the initial discussions in this lesson and the eventual investigations and discussions through the rest of the unit, students will progress in their ability to analyze data and identify causal vs. correlational relationships.\\n \\nto each student so they can annotate it and include it in their student notebook. In addition, distribute both Earth squish ball globes and 2 coffee sleeves to each pair in a group to use as reference.\\n\\nIn the next part of the lesson, students will read about five different mountain peaks and their ranges. This first one is about the Himalayas where Mt. Everest is located. Analyze this first case site as a class to find the types of data we are looking for to help us figure out more about changes to other mountains besides Mt. Everest.\\n\\nSay, Mt. Everest is just one mountain that is part of a mountain range called the Himalayas. Let�s analyze the data card about the Himalayas to look for any other data that could help us in figuring out more about Everest and why it is changing. Give students a couple of minutes to look at the different pieces of information on the card. Ask students to share any data they see or read on the card that we should add to the table in our notebook. For each suggestion, probe the student as to why they think this piece of information is important to record and why it might help us figure out what is going on at Mt. Everest.\\n\\n\\nBelow are some examples of what students might suggest to underline or annotate from the Himalayas card and add to the data table in their notebook.\\n\\nPossible student suggestion\\tPossible student reasoning why to underline\\nUnderlining the location of the Himalayas.\\tKnowing where the mountain range is located might help us to figure out what is going on around Mt. Everest.\\nThere is another really tall mountain located in the Himalayas called K2.\\tMaybe all the mountains here are growing taller here since two of the tallest mountains are found in the same area.\\nThere is a lot of snow and ice in this area.\\tMaybe the new heights are from the snow and ice that is building up here.\\n\\nAs the class agrees on what is important from the Himalayas card, they should add that information to their notebook. An example of a data table is included below:\\n \\n\\nType of data\\tData\\tHow this data connects to mountains changing\\nHeight or elevation of mountain\\tEverest is 29,032 feet.\\nAnother mountain in the Himalayas is also very tall.\\tMaybe all the mountains in the Himalayas tall.\\nEarthquake activity\\tThere are many large earthquakes in the area.\\tMaybe earthquakes are connected to mountains moving.\\nOther data\\tThere is a lot of snow and ice in the Himalayas.\\tMaybe this is why the height keeps getting taller.\\n\\n\\nAssign one mountain case card to each student within a small group. After reading through the Mt. Everest in the Himalayas card together, form small groups of three to four students. Each student within a group will read one of the remaining five Data Cards for Other Mountains and Mt. Everest. Organize the assignment of the five mountain cards so that more than one student in the class is reading each mountain card. Direct students to follow the same strategies we just used as a class to find pieces of data from these other mountains that could help us figure out what causes mountains to change over time. In addition to the maps on the front and back of the Data Cards, encourage students to use the two Earth squish ball globes to make sense of where the mountain they are analyzing is located on the globe. Give students about 8 minutes individually to read through the card they have been assigned.\\n\\nDuring this first analysis of the mountain case cards, students should look for data that could help the class figure out causes for mountains to change by finding potential patterns in the data. It is not necessary at this point for students to record all the data off of the mountain cards. Instead, through their analysis of the material they should pull out only the data that could help explain changes in elevation or lateral movement of mountains. ?\\n \\n \\n\\n9\\t� COMPARE MOUNTAIN SITE LOCATIONS\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n10\\t� SHARE PATTERNS IN GROWTH AND MOVEMENT BETWEEN DIFFERENT MOUNTAINS\\t13 min\\n\\n \\nRecord all of these that the class agrees makes sense to include on a large 4� x 6� sticky note. Using the sticky notes or quarter sheets of paper, annotate the different mountain peak locations with similar patterns of data, and place it on the map near the mountain peak the data is referring to.\\nThese patterns of data should be pieces that we feel will help us figure out Mt. Everest as well. As students share, record the different data on the sticky notes and post them on the map in the location of the mountain range. See the example to the right.\\n\\nSome examples of data students may suggest to record on the sticky notes for the different mountain peaks is included below:\\n\\nMt. Mitchell:\\n?\\tMt. Mitchell moves on average 3 cm each year towards the west.\\n?\\tThe Appalachian mountains are ancient.\\n?\\tThey are believed to have been as tall or taller than the Himalayas.\\n?\\tThe peaks are decreasing in height and the valleys are getting deeper.\\n?\\tThere is volcanic rock in these mountains. (Does that mean there are volcanoes here?)\\n?\\tThere are no active earthquakes.\\nMt. Cook:\\n?\\tThere are regular earthquakes in the area.\\n?\\tOne earthquake caused part of the ocean floor to rise above the water.\\n?\\tThese mountains are increasing in height 1-2 cm/year.\\n?\\tThis area is moving 6.9 cm towards the north.\\nMt. Aconcagua\\n?\\tThese are moving about 3 cm per year to the north.\\n?\\tThe mountains are the tallest mountains after the Himalayas.\\n?\\tThe tallest peak is 22,838 ft tall.\\n?\\tThe tallest active volcano can be found in these mountains.\\n?\\tThese mountains are the same age as the Himalayas.\\n?\\tThese mountains are still increasing in elevation through growth spurts.\\nMount Hotaka\\n?\\tThese mountains are younger than the Himalayas.\\n?\\tThere are several active volcanoes in these mountains.\\nMount Narodnaya\\n?\\tThese mountains are much older than the Himalayas and about as old as the Appalachians.\\n?\\tEarthquakes can occur here, but they are small and not common.\\n \\n?\\tThese mountains are moving about 2.5 cm to the east each year.\\n?\\tThis mountain is much shorter than Mt. Everest.\\n\\nLook for patterns across the different mountains. Say, Now that we have recorded the pieces of data for each mountain, let�s share the patterns of similarities and differences that your group found between the mountain cases. Use the prompts below to lead a discussion about what patterns students noticed between the different mountains and how they change. You may wish to add some of these to the large sticky notes as students share.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat are some patterns of change you noticed between the different mountains?\\n \\nAlmost all the mountains are growing except for Mt.

Display slide O. Say, Last class we found data that some mountains are not growing but are shrinking. So if all mountains aren�t growing, then our initial consensus model won�t explain what is happening to every mountain. As a class, let�s develop a model to capture the ideas we have for what we think might be causing other mountains to shrink.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nInclude all ideas at this point in the unit as part of the consensus model. The purpose of developing this model is to surface ideas students have for what could be causing\\n \\nLet�s begin our class model by representing what we know from data.\\nWhat are some things we should be sure to include in our class model? How should we begin our model of a shrinking mountain?\\n\\n\\n\\nSo these mountains that are shrinking are shorter than Mt. Everest now, but were they always?\\n\\nIf we want to model what causes a mountain to shrink, then how can we capture that these mountains were as tall or taller than Mt.\\nEverest but are now shorter?\\n \\nWe should include a mountain like we did for Everest, but it should be\\nshorter than our model for Everest.\\n\\nYeah, both the mountains we read about that are shrinking are shorter than Everest.\\n\\nNo � it says they were as tall or taller than Everest.\\n\\n\\nWe should draw more than one image of the mountain ... like before and after.\\n\\nYeah, so we can show what happens over time to the mountain.\\n \\nchanges to Earth. If everyone doesn�t agree with some of the ideas shared, then include the ideas as questions or with question marks. Don�t worry about fleshing out every similarity or difference. For example, you can say to the group, So it sounds like some people have X, but not everyone is totally convinced yet. Let�s put it up with a question mark. Does everyone agree that we�re not totally in agreement about X? Consensus can mean we agree that we�re not in consensus.\\n \\n\\n \\nOkay, so how should we represent that these mountains have shrunk over time?\\n \\nWe should have a tall mountain for the before section, then a shorter mountain for now.\\n\\nWe could also add an arrow pointing down from the top of the mountain to represent it getting shorter.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat are some of our ideas for what causes these changes? What is causing some mountains to shrink?\\n \\nI think maybe there are things happening underneath the mountain, like maybe the plates are moving or breaking.\\n\\nOr maybe the snow at the top of the mountain is melting and that is causing the mountain to shrink.\\n\\nI think wind and rain could be causing the mountain to shrink by erosion.\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� BRAINSTORM RELATED PHENOMENA\\t15 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nYou can read students� questions as a formative assessment prior to the next class and then again later in the unit to see how students� questions are developing.

Everest Moves And Grows, Explaining Other Mountains That Shrink, Patterns Of Change For Mountains, markers, sticky notes\\n\\n \\nRecord individual questions. Make sure markers and sticky notes are provided. Say, Let�s look back at our noticings and wonderings, What is happening on Mount Everest?, Explain How Mt. Everest Moves And Grows, and Explaining Other Mountains That Shrink, and Patterns Of Change For Mountains to capture our questions about what is happening in these different cases where mountains are changing and where other changes are happening to the land around us. We will use these questions to form our Driving Question Board.\\n\\nTo prompt an array of questions, remind students to think carefully about the changes happening to Mt. Everest, any changes to the mountains described in the cards, and other related phenomena.\\n\\nPresent slide U. Give students at least 3 minutes to generate their questions on sticky notes. Encourage students to write more than one question, but only one question per sticky note, and put their initials in pencil on the back of each.\\n\\nWhile students write questions, move the Related Phenomena poster to hang next to the Initial Consensus Model posters where all students can see it from a Scientists Circle. These posters together will serve as the space where students can add their questions to build their DQB, and will be referred to as the DQB in subsequent activities and lessons.\\n\\nGather in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Present slide V. Have students bring their science notebooks and all of their sticky note questions along with a chair and form a circle in a location where everyone can see the two Initial Consensus Models and the Related\\nPhenomena poster. These three posters will serve as the DQB for this unit.\\n\\nRemind students that our goal is to capture all our questions to build a DQB. Say something like, It looks like you have a lot of really good questions about what could be causing changes to different mountains and different locations on Earth. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have similar questions. To help us group similar questions, let�s try to post each question on a spot on one of the Initial Consensus Model posters or on the Related Phenomena poster, or in between them.\\n\\nReview these steps for forming the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student comes up to the DQB with a sticky note, faces the class, and stays standing.\\n?\\tThe student reads their question off the note and then posts it on the DQB near the section of the consensus model or related phenomena it is most related to.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe next student reads their question and posts it on the DQB. This student also says what other posted questions it relates to and explains why or how it relates.?\\n?\\tThe student then selects the next student whose hand is raised.?\\n?\\tThis process continues until everyone has had a chance to post a question.\\n?\\tRemind students to keep track of whether their question was already asked, put a checkmark on that sticky note if it was, and then select a different question to share.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nIf students forget to explain how or why their questions are linked to someone else�s question, press them to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off each other�s ideas, and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions raised are not part of topics in this unit. Over time, with practice in this type of activity, students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the DQB. If students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n\\nIf a question is similar to (or the same as) another one, have the student place it on top of that question so other students can visualize how many questions are identical or related. Emphasize that this provides us with evidence of where many people are thinking about similar things.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nHaving the student who volunteered and posted a question choose the next student to share (from those whose hands are raised)\\n \\nis a great way to turn over the pacing and cadence of this group work to the students. Reuse this technique in future Scientists Circles to encourage increased student agency in the classroom learning community. When you do this, take a seat with the students in the circle to position yourself as an equal member of the learning community who is listening, making sense of questions, and trying to figure this out. If you have questions you want to share with the group, raise your hand and wait for someone to call on you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce the class agrees to this, write it in large letters on a half-piece of chart paper and hang this banner over the top of the entire DQB. Remind students that we can revise this question as we continue to figure out new things in future lessons. Ask students to go to the blank page they saved in their notebook for the title of this unit and record this title now.\\n \\n \\n\\n17\\t� BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR DATA AND INFORMATION NEEDED\\t12 min\\n\\n \\nAs students are doing this, hang the Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need poster right next to the DQB.\\n\\nIn the remaining 9 minutes, have students reconvene standing in a semi-circle around the Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need poster so all can see it. Give each group of students about one minute to report out the data and information that could answer their questions. Record a list of Information and Data Needed that will remain public throughout the unit. Make sure all groups get to share at least one idea.\\n\\nBuild the poster with students� ideas. Tell students you want everyone�s ideas to be shared and represented on the poster. Say something like, To make sure we have your ideas up here, I will pass a marker to the first person on the edge of the circle. That student should share one idea. I will write it up and number it. Once I�ve almost finished writing it, that student should pass the marker to the student next to them. The second student then shares an idea. If that idea is on the poster already, the student should say which idea it is and how it is similar. I will put a tally mark next to it. The marker is then passed and we continue until we have heard once from everyone in the class. If you have additional ideas that don�t end up on the poster, feel free to raise your hand after the marker makes it all the way around the circle. If we run out of time, we�ll pick up here in the next class. And if you think of new ideas as we go, feel free to jot them down. We should always be thinking of ways we can add to this list.\\n\\nA sample poster from one class of students is shown here.\\n\\nCelebrate the formation of a joint enterprise. Once this poster is built, celebrate that they created a joint mission and proposed action plan to guide the work of our learning community for weeks to come. Say something like, Wow. We have accomplished so much. We now have a mission to accomplish as a class, thanks to all the questions you shared and how you connected them. These questions really represent what we hope to figure out. And we have a lot of ideas for investigations and data sources we can work with. I am very excited for us to start investigating all of these. I have lots of additional data and equipment for us to use that are well matched to the things you�ve said we need. Let�s plan to start exploring some of this in our next lesson.\\n\\nPrioritize one set of ideas for investigations. If time permits, say something like, I noticed we have many different ideas for what could be causing the changes we saw in the different mountains. What cause makes sense to figure out more about first? Give students a minute or two to turn and talk with a partner.\\n \\n18\\t� NAVIGATION\\t3 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\nDecide where to go next. Display slide X. Say, As you look back at the DQB and think about the ideas shared for investigations and types of data we would want, what makes sense to explore first?

From the reading and photographs, we learn that when a tsunami reaches land, it may result in catastrophic loss of life and property. Two video clips help us further explore how this phenomenon impacts people and structures. We brainstorm and develop several engineering ideas to help detect tsunamis, provide advance warning of their approach, and reduce their impact. While evaluating our initial ideas, we notice patterns about what makes some engineering solutions more promising or challenging than others. Finally, we brainstorm related phenomena (local natural hazards) and ask questions to generate a list of data and information we need to better understand where natural hazards occur and how we can prepare for them.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-ESS3-2, MS-ETS1-1, MS-ETS1-2\\n\\n \\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tAsk questions that arise from careful observations of a sudden natural event that causes damage to communities.\\n\\n1.B\\tApply scientific ideas to design an object, tool, process, or system that detects a tsunami when it starts (cause) and warns people or reduces damage to communities (effect).\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\nWe will figure out these ideas about tsunamis:\\n?\\tA tsunami is a large wave or surge of water that results from the movement of the ocean floor (e.g., an earthquake).\\n?\\tTsunamis cause damage to communities through major flooding of low-lying areas, impacting homes and property and making it hard for people to live there.\\n\\nWe will figure out these ideas about designing engineering solutions:\\n?\\tProposed engineering solutions for tsunami response include a system of detection sensors, warning plans, and solutions for reducing damage.\\n?\\tThough communities may be impacted by different kinds of natural hazards, a response to most hazards often requires engineers to\\n \\ndesign technologies that can detect, warn people, and reduce damage.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Learning Plan Snapshot\\nPart\\tDuration\\tSummary\\tSlide\\tMaterials\\n\\n1\\t7 min\\tINTRODUCE THE TSUNAMI PHENOMENON\\nIntroduce the tsunami phenomenon through a brief reading and a series of photographs.

A helpful distinction is whether the term is earned or encountered. A word we earn is one we work together to understand through investigation and collaborative sensemaking, thus we celebrate our growing understanding by adding it to the wall. A word we encounter may be introduced through text or other media and is often defined for us. If our understanding of this word grows during\\n \\nthe lesson or unit, we can then consider it to be a word that we earn. During day 1, add words we encounter from the reading. This unit will also include words from previous units as students revisit some words from the OpenSciEd Unit 6.4: What causes Earth�s surface to change? (Everest Unit), which might be helpful to put back on the Word Wall so students can apply them in another context.\\n\\nPrepare all posters using chart paper and markers:\\n?\\tday 1 - Notice and Wonder poster\\n?\\tday 2 - Detect Tsunamis poster, Warn People poster, Reduce Damage poster, Local Hazards poster, Technologies and Related Solutions poster\\n?\\tday 3 - Driving Question Board (DQB) poster(s), Ideas for Investigation and Information We Need poster\\n\\nPoster guidance: Determine where to set up the DQB prior to day 3. Also, several posters can be combined into one to save space if necessary; for example, on day 2, the Detect Tsunamis, Warn People, and Reduce Damage posters could be combined.\\n\\nOptional: For day 1, position the World Map from the Everest Unit where everyone can view it. This is used before the reading to locate Japan, Indonesia, and the Indian Ocean. The map serves not only as a way to locate natural hazards around the world but also to help connect the occurrence of certain natural hazards (i.e., tsunamis) with Earth�s geologic processes explored in the Everest Unit. Alternatively, you can project a world map without any reference to other geologic processes (e.g., earthquakes). Students will have an opportunity to observe the connections between earthquakes and tsunamis using maps during Lesson 2.\\n\\nTo encourage productive discussions throughout this unit, display the Communicating in Scientific Ways poster in a place where students can reference it.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nStudents engage with the anchor phenomenon through a brief informational reading, several photographs, and two video clips showing a rapid surge of water, triggered by an earthquake, overtaking the eastern coast of Japan. They are then motivated to brainstorm and develop several engineering ideas to help detect tsunamis, provide advance warning of their approach, and reduce their impact. The purpose of the anchor is to probe students� understanding of how Earth�s natural processes are related to specific natural hazards. It leverages their ideas about geologic processes (i.e., earthquakes) and other natural hazards (i.e., floods, wildfires). The anchor then encourages students to use their observations to develop engineering solutions to reduce a tsunami�s impact. As they think more deeply about their proposed solutions, they notice patterns in what makes some more promising or challenging than others. Finally, as students consider related phenomena, the anchor motivates them to think more broadly about how scientists forecast which areas are most at risk for natural hazards and how engineers evaluate proposed solutions to reduce their impact.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nAs students share their ideas, they may mention what they already know about earthquakes, tsunamis, tidal waves, and tsunami barriers. In terms of geologic forces, specifically earthquakes, encourage them to use their knowledge from the Everest Unit. Similarly, when discussing related phenomena, encourage students to discuss any personal experiences with other natural hazards. In both cases, however, avoid giving too much away at this point in the unit (for example, do not discuss in detail the connection between earthquakes and tsunamis as these ideas will emerge in subsequent lessons).\\n\\nLessons 2-5 will draw upon these particular areas of students� prior knowledge:\\n?\\tEarthquakes that occur along specific plate boundaries often cause the ocean floor to shift, triggering tsunamis.\\n?\\tThe energy of a tsunami can be described in terms of wave speed and wave height. Many tsunami-specific engineering solutions involve dissipating the energy of the wave.\\n?\\tAs engineers decide upon criteria and constraints in their design process, they consider factors such as what knowledge is available, what technology is available, and what the affected communities need and value.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE THE TSUNAMI PHENOMENON\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: Tsunami: Japan 2011, science notebook, World Map (from Everest Unit)\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the phenomenon. Say something like, I want to share some information with you about a phenomenon that impacts places where many people live. When it happens, structures can be damaged and people can be hurt, or even die, as a result. This phenomenon is called a tsunami. Has anyone heard of this before?\\n\\nLet students share a few initial ideas with the class.\\n\\nIntroduce the reading and photographs. Project slide A. Tell students that the slide shows a tsunami wave reaching the eastern coast of Japan in 2011. Say, We have a reading that talks about events that occurred in Japan and Indonesia. It might be helpful to know where these places are. Can someone show us Japan and Indonesia on the map?\\n\\nHave a volunteer point out the approximate locations of Japan and Indonesia on the World Map.\\nUse sticky notes or some other method to mark them for reference throughout the unit (see reference map with arrows showing Japanese and Indonesian islands).\\n\\nDistribute a copy of Tsunami: Japan 2011 to each student.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: In this unit, Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions is a focal SEP. Therefore, numerous scaffolds exist to support students in this practice in the context of natural hazards. If you believe your students are ready to proceed with less support, we recommend first removing scaffolding related to practices that are not focal in this unit. For example, though modeling is used in many activities, it is likely a familiar practice, as students have engaged with it in previous units. Therefore, consider asking students to generate their own models without offering them supplemental image starters or handouts (often provided throughout this unit). However, take caution when removing scaffolding, as it is designed to ensure greater access and to help remove barriers to understanding complex phenomena.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Previewing or pausing to discuss technical terms in the text can be particularly helpful for emergent multilingual learners, students with dyslexia, and students who read below\\n \\n\\nRead text and examine photos. Give students 5 minutes to complete Part 1 of their handout individually by reading the text, examining the photographs, and marking things they notice or wonder about.?\\n\\nFor the reading, ask students to mark the text using your typical classroom annotation protocol, such as underlining or circling. Remind them to take notes or write questions about any unfamiliar words on their handout.?\\n\\n\\nFor the photos, ask students to circle or use arrows to point out parts of the images that attract their attention. At this point, let them select things they find interesting without guiding them to compare or look for certain details. Some details may be obscure as the images are taken from video footage, but the interaction between land and water should be clear.\\n\\nSet up a Notice and Wonder chart. Present slide B. Have students find a blank page on the left side of their science notebooks and title the page, �Tsunami Phenomenon.� Then, have them make a two-column chart to record their noticings (left column) and wonderings (right column) from the reading and photographs.\\n\\nGive students 1-2 minutes to record in this chart what they noticed and wondered about from the reading and photographs. Tell them we will share noticings and wonderings later, after we view video footage from this event.\\n \\ngrade level. These words include: magnitude, aftershocks, and tsunami. At this point, the term magnitude should be included on the Word Wall as a �word from a previous unit.�\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� WATCH TSUNAMI VIDEO\\t8 min\\n\\n \\nuse science to understand them better, predict when they may occur, and make more informed decisions about what to do when they happen.\\n\\nFor further guidance on what to say to your students before viewing this phenomenon, please refer to the Guidance callout; for guidance on supporting student reactions and experiences with natural hazards, see the Guidance callout.\\n\\n\\nWatch the video. Explain to students that you will play the video twice, and recommend that they simply watch during the first playthrough. Play the video at https://youtu.be/qkswBWul-gg . Consider pausing on video transitions so students can orient themselves to the map locations of where the video was taken.\\n\\nBefore playing the video a second time, instruct students to draw a line in their notebook beneath their noticings and wonderings from the reading and photographs, and to record their noticings and wonderings from the videos below this line during the second playthrough.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� SHARE NOTICINGS AND WONDERINGS\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� INITIAL ENGINEERING IDEAS\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Tsunami: Japan 2011, science notebook\\n\\nBrainstorm initial ideas individually. Explain to students that because natural hazards like tsunamis affect people and communities frequently, scientists and engineers want to come up with solutions to help protect them. Say, We saw that this natural event can do a lot of damage to land, buildings, other property, and sometimes even human lives. Devastating events like tsunamis motivate people to study why they occur, how they work, and also how to reduce their effects. As scientists understand these events better, engineers can use that knowledge to help design solutions to protect or warn us. Therefore, in this unit, we will think like both scientists and engineers.\\n\\nDisplay slide E. Explain that we will now think about the tsunami again, but from an engineering perspective. Prompt students to come up with ideas to detect tsunamis, warn people of their approach, and reduce the damage they cause.\\n\\nSay, You�ve all noticed some interesting things from the reading, photos, and videos. As you brainstorm engineering ideas, use what you already recorded in your notebook about what you noticed during the tsunami to help you think about how people and communities could be protected and warned in the future. Give students 5 minutes to brainstorm and record their ideas in Part 2 of their handout. Encourage them to think of at least one idea for each column.\\n\\nDevelop initial ideas. Display slide F. Ask students to pick one idea from their initial brainstorm to model and explain more thoroughly in their handout. Say, Pick one of your ideas. Show how it would work using a diagram and then write a short explanation. Remember to label your diagram so someone else could understand how your design works.\\n\\nAfter 5 minutes, ask students to pick an idea from a different category to model and explain more thoroughly. Give students 5 minutes to model and explain their second idea in greater detail. Tell them to be prepared to share their ideas with a partner.\\n\\n5\\t� SHARE INITIAL IDEAS AND NAVIGATION\\t15 min\\n\\n \\nPromote collaboration. Display slide G. Transition to initial ideas discussion by reminding students of classroom norms.\\n\\nExplain to students that it�s important to look at each other�s ideas so we can see things from other perspectives. Say, Just as scientists do not work in isolation, engineers often collaborate. How might this help engineers and scientists when they are trying to figure out how things work and then how to design solutions? Have a few students share their ideas for why collaboration is important in science.\\n\\nSay, Right! Collaboration is important in science because then we can use many diverse ideas and see things from different points of view, which is important as we try to design systems that address a variety of needs or criteria and can help as many people as possible.\\n\\nShare initial ideas in pairs.? Display slide H. Tell students that in order to share ideas and be inspired by the ideas of others, they will pair up with a fellow classmate/engineer three times.\\n\\nExplain that in each pairing, students will decide who speaks first. The speaker has 1 minute to describe one of their developed ideas. The listener writes notes about the idea in Part 3 of their own handout and identifies whether the idea is meant to help detect, warn people, or reduce damage. Emphasize that this is not the time to ask a lot of questions about the design; it is simply time to record their peer�s idea. Then students will switch roles after 1 minute so each partner has the opportunity to share their idea. Give students approximately 10 minutes to engage in 3 pairings. For further guidance on running this activity, see the guidance callout.\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nDuring these partner discussions, do not correct students� misuse of language. An Initial Ideas Discussion is used to encourage students to share their prior knowledge on a topic and generate divergent thinking. Some students may refer to wave amplitude, wavelength, seismometers, tsunameters, wave breaks, or tsunami barriers. Rather than stopping them from using these terms, you might ask them to briefly offer an explanation. Avoid pushing for clear, developed definitions; it may be more effective to simply note any new terms that emerge as ones the class needs to learn\\n \\n\\t\\tmore about. Students will refine their\\nunderstanding of these terms as they progress through the unit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNavigate to close day 1. Display slide I. Say, As I walked around, I noticed lots of different ideas for detecting tsunamis, warning people about them, and reducing the damage they cause. Interestingly, I also noticed similarities across many of these ideas. Does anyone want to share any similarities they noticed? Call on a few students to share.\\n\\nClose the class with, In our next class, let�s look at the ideas we came up with and consider how we could organize them so we can begin to think about which solutions might be better than others. Remind students to leave their handouts in the classroom so you can look at\\ntheir developed ideas before the next class period.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\n\\nBuilding towards: 1.B Apply scientific ideas to design an object, tool, process, or system that detects a tsunami when it starts (cause) and warns people, or reduces damage to communities (effect).\\n\\nThis is the first point in this lesson that you can assess students on this lesson-level performance expectation. You can also assess students on day 2 as they discuss promising and challenging aspects of designs, and on day 3 when the class discusses how to design solutions to reduce the impact of natural hazards on communities.\\n\\nWhat to look for/listen for (in the initial designs):\\n?\\tAt least one drawing or written description of an idea to either help detect tsunamis, give people more advance warning, or help reduce the damage caused by tsunamis.\\n?\\tIdeas that indicate a characteristic of the tsunami wave that would be important to consider in the design, such as the start of the hazard (e.g., earthquake); or how fast, big, or intense the wave becomes; or a method for blocking the wave from reaching a community.\\n\\nThroughout Lesson 1, look for/listen for these things: (1) agreement that though tsunamis may cause devastation, their effects can be reduced by solutions that detect, warn people, and reduce damage; (2) agreement that some engineering solutions may be more promising or challenging than others; and (3) uncertainty or disagreement about what makes one solution more promising or challenging than another.\\n\\nWhat to do: If your students struggle to think of engineering ideas, ask them to consider what might be dangerous about the giant waves reaching land. Use a physical analogy to help them recognize the weight of water: Ask whether they think water is heavy or light. Fill a 5-gallon bucket or similar container with water and ask a student to pick it up. Ask them what it might feel like to get hit by that much water. Remind them that a tsunami wave carries millions of times more water than the bucket. Remind them of the cars, airplanes, and helicopters they saw swept away during the second video clip.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n\\n6\\t� NAVIGATION\\t1 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� SHARE INITIAL ENGINEERING IDEAS\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n8\\t� EVALUATE INITIAL ENGINEERING IDEAS\\t20 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: Tsunami: Japan 2011, Detect Tsunamis poster, Warn People poster, Reduce Damage poster, markers, optional: small stickers, sticky notes\\n\\n \\nShift to evaluating engineering ideas. Display only the first two prompts on slide K. Say, Part of engineering is coming up with new ideas to solve problems. However, engineers also use their expertise to evaluate a plan that�s already being used or one that has been proposed. As part of their evaluation, they ask, �Does this idea show promise?� or �Does this idea seem challenging?� So, let�s try that with our ideas.\\n\\nPrompt students to turn to Part 4 of their handout. Tell them to individually write down the idea they think shows the most promise and explain their rationale; then, to write down the idea that seems most challenging to implement and explain why. Give students 5 minutes to complete these prompts.\\n\\nPrepare for whole-class discussion. Students are now ready to develop criteria and constraints that could be used to evaluate the engineering solutions they proposed on day 1. To help them build toward these concepts, tell them that we will now share our rationales and evaluate the ideas as a class. Say, In this discussion we will try to identify any patterns for promising ideas and those that may be more challenging. We are not identifying �good� and �bad� ideas because we don�t know yet what makes one idea good and another bad. Instead, let�s start with our own first impressions about whether an idea seems easier or more difficult to implement.?\\n\\nFacilitate discussion to evaluate engineering ideas. Ask a volunteer to share one idea they identified as most promising or most challenging and then to explain their reasoning. After the student shares, say to the class, Did anyone else think something similar about that idea? If at least 3 students agree, use markers or stickers on the appropriate poster to clearly indicate the idea as either promising (i.e., green dot), or challenging (i.e., red dot). For the next 10 minutes, continue this process by asking other students to share ideas and polling the class for agreement.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ARGUMENT FROM EVIDENCE\\n\\nThis is an opportunity to support students in developing productive argumentation practices. Remind them of classroom norms around discussing or critiquing a classmate�s idea. Emphasize that critiquing the idea is not the same thing as criticizing the person who came up with it. Encourage students to use language such as, I agree with the idea that \\tshared or I disagree with this idea because \\t\\t. It may be helpful to remind them to use the Communicating in Scientific Ways poster.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nFor the next 5 minutes, ask students if they notice any patterns in the evaluated ideas. Say, Do you notice any patterns when you look at all the promising ideas? What if we look at only the challenging ideas? Do any patterns emerge?\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompt\\n \\nSample student response\\n \\nFollow-up question\\n \\n\\n \\nDo you notice any patterns if we look at all the promising ideas?\\n \\nThey don�t seem to require inventing any new technology, like cell phones, so we can already communicate and warn people quickly.\\n\\nIt seems like we could make some of these happen really quickly because we will use existing technology, like GPS and satellite dishes.\\n\\nSome probably won�t make people change their daily habits, like move out of their homes, so that makes them easier.\\n \\nWhat makes an idea promising?\\n\\nDoes this help us figure out something we think all tsunami-related solutions should take into account?\\n\\nDoes this help us figure out what a tsunami-related solution should be able to do?\\n \\n\\n \\nDo you notice any patterns if we look at all the challenging ideas?\\n \\nThey involve making new things, and that takes lots of time and money.\\n\\nWe may not know how to build something new because we�ve never done it before and it�ll need to be tested.\\n\\nThese plans all make people do something they don�t want to do, like move away from the ocean.\\n \\nWhat makes an idea challenging?\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n9\\t� NAVIGATE TO RELATED PHENOMENA\\t8 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students:\\nAsking students to consider related natural\\n \\nhazards may help you situate the anchor in a local context. By helping to make connections between the tsunami and events your students are likely to have experienced, or could experience in their own community, you provide opportunities for them to engage in more meaningful sensemaking, especially if they are permitted to demonstrate their understanding in a language of their choosing. As you do this, keep in mind students� cultures and languages, as this will help make the experience more accessible to your students.\\n\\n10\\t� DISCUSS RELATED PHENOMENA\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n11\\t� ASSIGN HOME LEARNING\\t2 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\n \\nAssign home learning to connect with family resources. Display slide O. Invite students to think more about natural hazards when they go home. Prompt them to talk with family members (preferably older ones, who are more likely to have experienced a natural hazard) to learn more about the hazards they have experienced.?\\n\\nSay, For home learning, share what we�ve learned about tsunamis with your family, and then ask if they have heard of or experienced any other natural hazards. It will be helpful to hear about their experiences and what they learned from them. Ask your family members if they remember when they first experienced the hazard and how they learned about what to do when it happened. Hearing from different people may give us more ideas about how to help people and communities prepare and then act when a hazard occurs.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis home learning opportunity will help students broaden their thinking to related phenomena beyond the case of the 2011 Japan tsunami. Even if family members live far away and have experienced very different natural hazards, it is important that students hear from people they know and trust about how they learned about these hazards and what to do when they occur. This broadening to related phenomena will give students an opportunity to leverage their family�s resources to augment their classroom learning, making the anchoring phenomenon more personally meaningful. There is an additional opportunity to add to this home learning as part of Lesson 2.\\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n12\\t� NAVIGATION TO STUDYING NATURAL HAZARDS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� CONNECT STUDYING NATURAL HAZARDS TO DESIGNING SOLUTIONS\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Tsunami: Japan 2011, Local Hazards poster, Technologies or Related Solutions poster, markers\\n\\nFacilitate whole-class discussion about studying natural hazards and designing solutions. Briefly revisit the Local Hazards poster and Technologies or Related Solutions poster to remind the class of what was discussed previously.\\n\\nDisplay slide Q. Give students 3 minutes to discuss the prompts on the slide with their neighbor.\\n\\nFor the next 7 minutes, prompt students to share their responses with the class. Remind them to draw from their home learning when appropriate.\\n\\nThe idea here is for students to connect their thinking around tsunamis specifically to natural hazards more broadly. It�s important to help them connect why and how we might study the 2011 Japan tsunami with how we might study natural hazards that affect other communities in order to develop a method for evaluating solutions designed to reduce their impact.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nHow do you think people determine which places are at risk for a natural hazard?\\n \\nMaybe look at some maps that show where natural hazards have occurred in the past.\\n\\nWe could talk to more people who have experienced natural hazards to see how often they happen.\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� DEVELOP QUESTIONS FOR THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t8 min\\n\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nInitial questions about a phenomenon are intended to clarify what information is known and not known; there are often more questions than answers when scientists begin their investigations. Develop a safe and supportive space for students� uncertainty, and focus on the need to ask and answer questions in order to address this uncertainty, which may require the entire unit to resolve.\\n \\n \\n\\n15\\t� DEVELOP THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t25 min\\nMATERIALS: questions written on sticky notes, Tsunami: Japan 2011, science notebook, Detect Tsunamis poster, Warn People poster, Reduce Damage poster, Local Hazards poster, Technologies or Related Solutions poster, DQB, markers\\n\\n \\nGather in a Scientists Circle. Display slide S. Instruct students that when their questions are ready, they need\\tto bring them along with their handout, science notebook, and a chair to meet in a Scientists Circle around the DQB.\\n\\nExplain to students how you will create the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student reads their question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB, near the part of the model the question most relates to.\\n?\\tStudents who are listening should raise their hand if one of their questions relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads their question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student, who may have a related question or a new question.\\n?\\tWe will continue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nStudents share and organize their questions, look/listen for questions about the tsunami in Japan specifically, about tsunamis in general, and about other natural hazards occurring around the world. Similarly, students will likely generate questions about engineering solutions that involve detecting, warning people, and reducing damage caused by tsunamis and other natural hazards.\\n\\nLook/listen for questions that are\\nopen-ended (e.g., why, how) and focus on either tsunamis specifically (e.g., How does the wave form? What happens when it reaches a community?) or other hazards more generally (e.g., Do all hazards happen that fast? How do people know when a hazard is about to impact their community?). If you notice close-ended questions,\\n \\nencourage the student to rephrase the question so that it cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuild the DQB and organize questions into categories. Display slide T, which shows the suggested format for the DQB. As students share, questions will naturally start clustering into groups such as (but not limited to) science questions related to hazards� causes, locations, and frequency of occurrence, as well as engineering questions related to cost, available resources, and what solutions are already being used. Give students approximately 20 minutes to share and add questions to the DQB.?\\n\\nWhen students finish sharing and placing questions on the DQB, have them look at the board for any additional organization that can be done. Once all the questions have been organized, ask students to consider the relationship between the �Science� and �Engineering� categories. Say, If we look at our questions, what link do we notice between our science and engineering questions? How will figuring out our questions about the hazards (science) help us design (engineer) ways to protect people and places? How would you describe the connection between science and engineering?\\n\\nAfter a number of students share and agree on at least one connection between the science and engineering questions, draw a thick arrow connecting �Science� to �Engineering.� Label the arrow with one or two agreed-upon connections. Explain that we will return to what this arrow represents in future lessons.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATION AND INFORMATION WE NEED\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n17\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\nMATERIALS: DQB\\n\\nDecide where to go next. Suggest to students that before we can tackle the engineering aspects of this unit, the part about how to prepare for a hazard, we need to know more about where they happen. Point to the questions on the DQB related to tsunami location or geography. Say, We have a lot of great ideas for ways to investigate natural hazards so we can design ways to protect the people and communities they affect. Let�s start with the questions we have about the tsunami. We seem to have questions about where they occur. Maybe we can use what we figure out about the locations of tsunamis to help us figure out more about other hazards.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nThe readings in this lesson encourage students to:\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RST.6-8.1: Cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of science and technical texts.\\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What happened in the student�s foot so they could walk again?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\n\\nWe share experiences of moving our bodies and also times when we were unable to.

Do not post this word on the wall until after your class has developed a shared understanding of its meaning.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nStudents begin this lesson by considering a phenomenon directly connected to their personal experience: a time when a part of their body was hurt or injured, which prevented them from being able to do a favorite activity for a short or long period. They are next presented with a case study of a middle school student�s multisystem foot injury, and they follow his healing journey by analyzing doctor�s notes and images.\\n\\nIn this lesson, students develop an initial definition for the word healing based on their prior experiences. Over the course of the unit, the definition is expanded and revised as students figure out more about the structure and function of different body parts and whether functions return to their original state prior to injury. Students explore different ways in which individuals experience or accomplish daily tasks. They begin to develop social-emotional skills around how people may have different abilities than themselves; they learn that sometimes these abilities are a result of an injury, but that it doesn�t mean the person isn�t healed or otherwise healthy. Although this unit builds off the systems thinking developed in other units, this is the first life science unit in OpenSciEd that considers living body systems.\\n\\nAs injury sometimes results in disability, this unit introduces students to the concept of disability as a natural and expected part of human diversity. The language in this unit reflects the idea that disability is neutral: neither tragic nor bad, nor inspirational. More information about disability to support teachers� instruction is given in Disability and Inclusion Awareness.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThis unit focuses on how the parts of the body work together as a system to function (move, grow, and the like) and restore function (heal), and how macro- and microlevel structures (and their corresponding functions) are involved in both. In this lesson, students begin this exploration by analyzing a case study of a middle school student who broke his foot.\\n\\nIt is not necessary for students to consider what is happening at the microscopic level in Lesson 1. They remain at the macroscopic level in the first three lessons and consider the parts of the foot from different perspectives, orientations, and interactions. In Lesson 4, students shift to microscopic exploration as they examine microscopic images or slides of different parts of the body. Motivation for this shift is built into the storyline toward the end of Lesson 3.\\n\\nThis unit does not explore the mechanisms of the immune system, or the body�s immune response to injury, in any greater detail than identifying the different components of blood (in Lesson 4). Additionally, though Lesson 1 presents data indicating that different parts or systems of the body heal at different rates (i.e., skin heals faster than bone, which heals faster than nerves), the differential lifespan of various cells is not addressed until Lesson 10.\\n\\nFinally, Lesson 1 does not focus on how the injury occurred, nor on the patient�s surgical procedure or external supports (cast, pins). These are merely shared so students can deduce what parts of the foot were injured and how the injury affected the foot�s function, and to help analyze data that could be evidence of healing over time.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� NAVIGATION\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook\\n\\n \\nElicit students� experiences of moving their bodies. Display slide A. Begin by asking students to stop and jot in their notebooks about their favorite activities that involve moving their body, and what parts of their body they use in that activity. Slide A is meant to elicit an array of movement experiences from students with diverse backgrounds. Take the opportunity to localize this phenomenon by revising the slide with images of activities in which your students may have more interest?. However, be mindful to include students with different abilities and interests.?\\n\\nAfter giving students a couple of minutes to write and process their ideas, have them share out with the class. Use the prompts below to guide the discussion.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\tFollow-up question\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nWhen selecting images to include in slide A, be sure that individuals with disabilities are represented. This will help students understand that disability is an aspect of human diversity and that individuals with disabilities have a range of interests and participate in a variety of activities.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\nWhat is your favorite activity that involves moving your body?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat parts of your body do you use when doing this activity?\\n \\nAccept all answers. For example:\\nDancing Riding a bike Painting\\nPlaying video games Jumping on a trampoline Climbing a tree\\nYoga\\n\\n\\nAccept all answers related to parts of the body. For example:\\nHands Feet Arms Leg(s) Head Eyes\\nNose and mouth\\n \\nWhat are some of your daily activities that involve moving your body?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is this body part useful for supporting the activity?\\n \\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: A science notebook gives students a space in which to reflect and communicate their developing understandings about science ideas and to track changes in those understanding. Encourage students to record their ideas using linguistic (written words) and nonlinguistic modes (photographs, drawings, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, measurements). This is especially important for emerging multilingual students because making connections between written words and nonlinguistic representations helps students generate richer explanations of scientific phenomena.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nAre there other parts of your body that we can�t see that support you doing this activity?\\n \\nAccept responses that are internal body structures. For example:\\nMuscles Bones Joints Tendons Ligaments Brain Heart\\nCore or abs Lungs\\n \\nHow are these body parts that we can�t see useful for supporting the activity?\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nHow do these body parts work together to do your activity?\\n \\nAccept all answers. For example:\\nWhen I dance, I use my core and my arms and my feet to move around. I use my mouth, nose, and lungs to breath, and my eyes to see where I am moving.\\n \\nCan anyone else think of how other body parts might be helpful for\\n\\t�s activity?\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nElicit students� experiences of being unable to do an activity.?? Display slide B. Using the slide and the prompts below, have students share out about times when something made them unable to use part of their body. Ask follow-up questions to push them to think more deeply about what was happening inside their body during that time, and whether other body parts were impacted, even if not directly affected by the injury.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\nWhy was your body not physically able to do this activity?\\tAccept all answers.

For example:\\nDays Weeks Months Never\\n \\n\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nMiddle school students are learning a lot about science, but it is important to honor the fact that they are already experts in their own experiences and that these are legitimate ways of knowing about the world. During this discussion, validate and encourage students as they share meaningful observations from their own lives by saying things like, That is very perceptive, has anybody else noticed that?\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: For students who are learning English or who need support following a class discussion, it can be helpful to use gestures in addition to talking. For example, as students describe their injuries, have them point to the body part and move their body to describe what they were unable to do. Keep in mind that you may have students with current injuries. Ask them to explain what they can�t currently do with their body. As appropriate, revoice what is shared while demonstrating the described actions with your own body.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\t� EXPLORE AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON\\t15 min\\n\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Emergency Room Report, Post-Operation Report, Recovery Reports, chart paper, marker\\nIntroduce the phenomenon. Display slide C. Say, I am going to tell you the story of a middle school student. Today, this student can walk, run, and jump! However, a while ago, he had an injury that prevented him from being able to do these things. He dropped a heavy weight on his foot during PE class. After this happened, he was not able to stand, walk, or run and had lots of pain.\\t? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\nUse the prompts below to elicit experiences and ideas about what happened from student volunteers.? Accept all responses.\\n?\\tHave you ever experienced something like this where you dropped something on your foot or another part of your body?\\n?\\tWhy do you think he was not able to do these activities with his body after the injury?\\t\\nInitial questions about a phenomenon are intended to clarify what information is known and not known; there are often more\\n \\n?\\tWhat happened in his body to allow him to get back to these activities?\\n?\\tWhat are you wondering about with his injury and journey to recovery?\\n\\nSay, I had lots of questions as well. Let�s take a look at some of the notes his doctor took along the way. We are going to notice and wonder about several time points, including when the patient was injured and during his recovery. Once we have all had a chance to record our noticings and wonderings, we will share our ideas as a class.\\n\\nNotice and wonder about the injury. Display slide D. Distribute the Emergency Room Report to each student. Tell students to read, annotate, and mark up their handout. If they ask what the word metatarsal refers to, ask them what they think that is based on what they read in the report. They should say that because it says two metatarsals are broken, and the x-ray shows two broken bones, metatarsals are two of the bones in the foot. After 2 minutes, bring the class together to share out what they noticed and wondered. Record this on a piece of chart paper titled �Noticings and Wonderings about the Injury�.\\n\\nNotice and wonder about what was done to the foot. Display slide E. Distribute the Post-Operation Report to each student. Have students read, annotate, and mark up their handout as before. After 2 minutes, bring the class together to share out what they noticed and wondered. Record this on a piece of chart paper titled �Noticings and Wonderings--Post Operation�.\\n \\nquestions than answers when scientists begin their investigations. Develop a safe and supportive space for students� uncertainty, and focus on the need to ask and answer questions in order to address the uncertainty that may require the entire unit to resolve.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNotice and wonder about the foot�s recovery process. Display slide F. Distribute the Recovery Reports. Give students 4 minutes to read, annotate, and mark up their handout for noticings and wonderings about steps in the healing process over time. After 4 minutes, bring the class together to share. You don�t need to make a record for the whole class, as you will use some of these noticings in the next activity.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nACTIVITY\\nRather than have students share out noticings and wondering with the class after each handout, you might consider jigsawing this activity in the following way:\\n1.\\tProvide a packet containing all three handouts for each student.\\n2.\\tPrompt students to skim all three handouts in chronological order.\\n3.\\tAssign groups of students to focus their noticings and wonderings on only one handout or report (the third handout contains four short recovery reports--these can be further jigsawed so groups focus on only one or two).\\n4.\\tBe sure to assign at least one group to each resource--multiple groups looking at each resource is preferable, as this ensures the essential details from each report are captured.\\n5.\\tAfter groups record their noticings and wonderings on their handouts, facilitate a class share out in which groups discuss their assigned resource.\\n\\nIf students struggle to make sense of the reports, consider reading and annotating the first handout as a class, then allow groups to read and annotate the rest. You might instruct them to annotate the reports in these ways:\\n?\\tUnderline things you notice or that grab your attention.\\n?\\tCircle things you wonder about.\\n?\\tAdd question marks to places where you are unsure of the information.\\n\\nNote: If the resources are jigsawed in this activity, be sure all assigned resources carry over into the next activity, when students look for and record evidence of healing. It may be easier and more efficient for students to continue examining the same resource in the next activity.\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\t� RECORD EVIDENCE FOR HEALING\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThe term healed can have a loaded meaning in the English language. In this unit, we use it to refer to the biological process that takes\\n \\nTitle a piece of chart paper �What Do We Mean by Healing?� and have students post their sticky notes on it. Instruct students to read through other sticky notes after posting their own. As they post, read some of their responses aloud. Once all students are seated, use the prompts below to facilitate a discussion around what they think it means to heal.\\n\\n\\nAdd healing and the co-constructed definition to the Word Wall. Your definition might be something like �the body trying to return to doing the things it was able to do before.�? Remind students that the Word Wall is a place to record our growing understanding of the word, and we will come back to it frequently to add more words or revise our definitions based on what we figure out in class.\\n \\nplace in the body in response to an injury. Sometimes injuries result in permanent disability after the body�s biological healing process has concluded. A person who becomes disabled as a result of an injury is no less healed than a person whose body fully returns to prior functionality.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: When developing new vocabulary, strategies that may benefit emergent multilingual learners are to use student-friendly definitions, make connections to cognate words when possible, and include a visual representation of the word. Use these strategies throughout the unit for both �words we earn� and �words we encounter.�\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: When students are tasked with expressing their ideas, allow them to do so through linguistic (oral and written language) and nonlinguistic (drawings, graphs, symbols, gestures) modes. For example, for a student who is having trouble articulating evidence from the images and doctor�s report, you might suggest sketching a picture on the handout. Providing emerging multilingual students with such opportunities allows them to use all their resources to express meaning.\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� CREATE A TIMELINE FOR HEALING\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SCALE,\\n \\nPROPORTION, AND QUANTITY\\n\\nCreating a timeline in this first lesson helps to map out the sequential events in the foot�s healing process. Over the course of the unit, students realize that different parts of the body take differing amounts of time to heal. In addition, they figure out what is happening at a microscopic scale during the healing process for each of these body parts. Students begin to connect the crosscutting concept of Scale, Proportion, and Quantity in regard to time and scale, and continue to develop this concept throughout the unit through additional investigations, models they develop, and explanations they construct.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nInclude on your timeline only the clues we have evidence for--the timeline should not include every note on the reports. If students feel adamant that an event from the report needs to be included but you feel that the evidence is insufficient, you might choose to include it with a question mark. See some suggested events and evidence on the following page.\\n\\n\\tRecovery Report #1\\tRecovery Report #2\\tRecovery Report #3\\tRecovery Report #4\\nSkin\\tStitches removed - The stitches were removed, so the skin must be closed up enough that the stitches aren\\'t needed.\\tSkin closed - No more opening in the skin, so it is healed.\\t\\t\\n \\n\\nBones\\tX-ray shows bones lined up\\n- If the bones are lined up, it seems they are on the way to healing and functioning.\\tPins removed - Bones are lined up, so they are on the way to healing and functioning.\\n\\nCast removed and post-op shoe used - This must mean the bone is stronger and healed.\\n\\nX-ray image - It is hard to see the fracture site - if we can�t see the break anymore, it�s probably healing.\\tBones lined up - Fracture lines are harder to see, so the bone has been put back together somehow.\\tFracture no longer visible - If the fracture can�t be seen, then the bone must be back together again.\\nMuscles\\t\\t\\tMore range of motion - The foot can move more, which might also be related to swelling and that it has healed more.\\tImproved range of motion - The foot can move even more, which is a sign of healing.\\nBlood\\t\\t\\tAdequate blood flow - This wasn�t mentioned before, but we saw it bleed when injured, so the amount of blood flow in the area must be important.\\tStrong blood flow - Maybe because some blood got out of the body, the blood had to somehow come back, and now it is �strong� where before it was just �adequate.�\\nSwelling\\tSwelling went down - The swelling began when the injury happened, so the swelling going down seems to indicate that the area is less injured.\\tMinimal swelling - Not sure what swelling does, but it is mentioned in almost all the notes, so it must be a clue of healing if the doctor was paying such careful attention to it.\\tMinimal swelling - Not sure what swelling does, but it is mentioned in almost all the notes, so it must be a clue of healing.\\tNo swelling - There isn�t any swelling anymore, so the foot must be healed and whatever the swelling did for the injury isn�t needed.\\n\\nTo ensure all evidence of healing is included on the timeline, use prompts such as these:\\n?\\tTake a moment and look back at the recovery report you analyzed. Do we have every clue with evidence from that report up on our timeline?\\n?\\tAre there any other clues from our recovery reports that we want to make sure are included on our timeline?\\n?\\tAre we missing any pieces of the progression for any types of events, like changes in swelling and so forth?\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n5\\t� NAVIGATION\\t3 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n6\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL OF HEALING\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Healing Initial Model\\n\\n \\nDevelop an initial model of the student�s healing process. Say, Let�s try to develop a model to explain �What happens during the healing process so the student was able to use his foot again to walk, run, jump, and dance?� Display slide K.?\\n\\nDistribute a copy of Healing Initial Model to each student. Tell students to put their name on their handout but not to add it to their notebooks yet, as you want to collect it at the end of class to get a sense of what they are thinking. Remind them that models allow us\\nto view a system from different perspectives and scales. Ask students to recall moments from previous units where it was useful to look at something from a different perspective or scale; see the prompt below.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nRemind students that in this classroom, a model is a picture and/or description that helps us explain something that happens in the world. As in previous OpenSciEd units, such models should try to do more than just show what we can see; they should also try\\n \\nDoes anyone remember how looking at something from a different perspective helped us figure more things out in an earlier unit?\\n \\nYeah! Like in the Everest Unit, when we moved from the top-down view to the side view of Earth�s crust, we could see that earthquakes occurred at different depths.\\n\\nI think in the Tsunami Unit, we looked at different wave models because each one had certain strengths and limitations, but when examined together we could figure out more. Sometimes we can understand more by looking at different perspectives at the same time.\\n \\nto represent any unobservable mechanisms and interactions that we think might be at work in the system to explain what we observe happening. Also, remind students that it�s OK if they don�t know the �right� answer when drawing models. At this stage, there are no �correct� ideas or questions--all are welcome. The goal of making an initial model is to make their thinking visible to others. Have students try to put any ideas down on paper using labels, pictures,\\n \\nExplain that we can draw the foot from various angles to examine it externally, but we can also think about what we might see under the skin and inside the foot, thanks to the x-rays in the reports. Regarding scale, we can zoom in to the site of the injury to help us better understand what we cannot normally see under the skin, and how these normally invisible changes might affect the whole foot.??\\n\\nAt the end, have students hand in Healing Initial Model as a formative assessment.\\n \\nsymbols, and/or words.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: In this unit, Developing and Using Models is a focal SEP. Therefore, numerous scaffolds\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinued from previous page�\\n\\nLook for inclusion of parts or interactions within the foot system that explain how the foot heals, aside from any aid from external processes or factors such as a cast or pins. Look for the following elements across their models and explanations to see if they bring these ideas to the table with the prompts for the task as written:\\n?\\tParts of the foot (system): bone, skin, muscle\\n?\\tMight also include: blood and nerves\\n?\\tHow the parts of the foot (system) worked together (interacted) to heal so the student could walk\\n\\nWhat to do: If students need support in choosing what to put in their models, refer them back to the Healing Timeline we developed as a class. Ask what they think might be happening with each part of the foot between when the injury happened until the student could walk again. Ask what was different in the parts of the foot right after the injury and after it was healed.\\n\\nStudents might include parts of the foot without representing how the parts interact or work together. If you notice this, remind them that we can also think about what�s going on inside the foot and underneath the skin because x-rays allow us to see some internal structures. Prompt them to include how the parts were interacting during the events in the Healing Timeline, and what we might see if we could look inside the foot at these interactions.\\n \\nexist to support this practice in the context of cells and healing. If you believe your students are ready to proceed with less support, we recommend first removing scaffolding related to practices that are not focal in this unit. For example, analyzing and interpreting data is likely a familiar practice, as students have engaged with it in previous units. Therefore, consider asking them to use their own methods to note similarities and differences when comparing images, or to organize and present evidence for a phenomenon, without offering them supplemental data tables, graphic organizers, or handouts (often provided throughout this unit). However, take caution when removing scaffolding, as it is designed to ensure greater access and to help remove barriers to understanding complex phenomena.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nSystems and Systems Models is a focal crosscutting concept for this unit. A system is an organized group of related objects or components. Here we refer to the different structures of the foot that are injured as �parts.� Scientists use models to understand and predict the behavior of systems. The first step in modeling a system is to set its boundary, and then to figure out the important parts. This allows scientists to study how the parts within a system interact to produce specific results. Help students set up their initial models as systems models by\\n \\nidentifying the important parts of each system and thinking about how those parts work together (interact).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\t� REVISIT CLASSROOM NORMS/COMMUNITY AGREEMENTS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Classroom Norms poster or slide\\n\\n \\nRevisit classroom norms established in previous units.? Display slide L. Take this opportunity to remind the class how we listen to one another, press on one another�s ideas, and ask questions of one another. Note that it�s OK to disagree with ideas but it�s important to be respectful.\\n\\nMention that it will be particularly important for us to be mindful of language we use when describing individual people�s bodies, experiences, and differences. Say, Let�s take a look back at our norms to see which one will help us most to create a classroom culture where we can share different experiences openly, make each other feel safe, and respect everyone�s personal experiences.\\n\\nYou can use slide M to remind students of the Classroom Norms (if you have developed your own set of norms, replace this slide with your norms). Ask students to choose one norm to personally work on for the rest of the class period.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Use classroom norms to support engagement by fostering an equitable learning community that promotes trusting and caring relationships. The norms should reinforce to students the value of (1) the diversity of thought among all classroom community members in pushing our learning forward and (2) providing a safe learning environment that ensures fair participation. In addition, classroom norms should interrupt cultural norms or stereotypes that could make science experiences feel uncomfortable for some students (e.g., someone may feel they are not intelligent enough to think like a scientist or may be unable or unconfident with sharing their thinking).\\n \\n\\n8\\t� COMPARE INITIAL MODELS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: It is important to create opportunities to support student engagement in meaningful, accountable talk by emphasizing socially safe activity structures, such as conducting small group or partner work before a class discussion. This is especially beneficial to emergent multilingual students. Partner talk or small group talk gives students an opportunity to share their ideas with one or two peers before �going public� with the whole class.\\n\\n9\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL OF HEALING\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Healing Timeline poster, markers, 2 copies of Printouts of the Foot, tape, chart paper, Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout\\n\\n \\nForm a Scientists Circle. Ask students to assemble their chairs in a circle and bring their science notebooks and something to write with. Students will remain in the circle for the remainder of class. Ideally, they should be able to see the slide and the Healing Timeline and have access to chart paper, but if that is not possible, use only the chart paper, which is where the more critical sensemaking will occur.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: Scaffolds such as sentence starters can model and facilitate particular oral or written language production skills such as formulating questions, hypotheses, explanations, or arguments based on evidence (see Communicating in Scientific Ways poster). Such scaffolds may be of particular benefit for emerging multilingual students to help them develop language skills to write or communicate their ideas to peers. It is important that scaffolds be used purposefully and removed when no longer needed.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS\\n \\nCONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRevisit the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters.? Make certain a Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout is visible. Emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. Ask students which sentence starters (see examples below) they might want to use to help them talk to one another.\\n\\nSay, To help you explain an idea, claim, prediction, or model to explain your data and observations, you could say:\\n?\\tMy idea is �\\n?\\tI think that �\\n?\\tWe could draw it this way � to show ...\\n\\nSay, To help you give evidence for your idea or claim:\\n?\\tMy evidence is �\\n?\\tThe reason I think that this evidence supports this is �\\n\\nOther examples of sentence starters could come from (1) listening to others� ideas and asking clarifying questions, (2) agreeing or disagreeing with others� ideas, and (3) adding onto others� ideas.\\n\\nInitiate a Consensus Discussion. Tell students that the class is now ready to have a Consensus Discussion.? Say, Remember, the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us figure out what is happening in the healing foot phenomenon. We also want to practice using our norms.\\n\\n \\nBecause this is our initial consensus model, we want to capture our competing ideas. For example, what is happening in the space, or gap, created after the bone and skin separated, as the foot heals? How is each part of the foot connected, allowing it to function when uninjured but not function immediately after the injury?\\n\\nUse question marks in the consensus model to show where we have some different ideas or uncertainty. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over others so as not to give away what might be going on in the phenomenon. The class can revisit and evaluate their initial competing ideas as they gather more evidence throughout the unit.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Universal Design for Learning: Use representations like color coding and/or letter or number coding to foreground parts of the model. Create a key to track the coding you use. Although color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding helps ensure accessibility for any student who may be color blind. If color coding is used, consider a palette of orange, blue, black, and/or dark brown.\\n \\n\\nCapture similarities and differences in students� initial models. Display slide O. Use prompts such as those on slide O to develop an initial consensus model.?\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConsider using a round-robin format to give every student a chance to either share something they wrote in their own model or comment respectfully on something someone else has shared. As students share out, use their ideas to draw an initial consensus model on the printouts of the feet above the timeline.\\n\\nWork through the locations in the model in this strategic order by starting with the healed foot and/or an uninjured foot, using the prompts below.\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompt\\n \\nSample student response\\n \\nFollow-up question\\n \\n\\n \\nLet\\'s start by modeling the healed/uninjured foot. What parts, or structures, should we include on the healed/uninjured foot?\\n \\nSkin, bone, muscle\\n(Students might also add blood and nerves.)\\n \\nAre there any other parts of the foot or body we might need to include?\\n \\n\\n \\nIf we could see inside the foot, what would we see?\\n \\nWe would see the bone. We would see the muscle.\\nThere should be blood inside the foot.\\n\\nThe skin would not be opened up anymore, but it might have a scar.\\n \\nWhat about the skin? Does the skin count as something �inside the foot�?\\n \\n\\n \\nHow would we represent each of these parts of the foot in our model?\\n \\nI think the skin should be closer to the outline of the foot, then the muscle, and the bone on the inside. It feels like the bone is more inside than the skin or muscle.\\n\\nMaybe the skin could be made to look like a thin layer, because it seems really easy to break this layer and for blood to come out.\\n \\nGreat! Let�s write that down as something we want to know about, and we can leave it as a question mark in our model.\\n \\n\\n\\nMaybe the bones could look thicker, because they are hard and difficult to break--otherwise we would probably break our bones more often.\\n\\n \\nHow do these parts look different on the injured foot right after the injury occured?\\n\\nNote: The three parts of the foot that should be represented on the consensus model are skin, bone, and muscle. Feel free to include other parts the class agrees upon and any parts there might be disagreement or questions about.\\nFor example, some students may mention nerves, so your model might include nerves with a question mark.\\n \\nThe skin was opened up from the injury, and there was dried blood on the skin.\\n\\nThe x-rays showed two of the bones in the foot were broken and crooked (not lined up anymore).\\n\\nThere was lots of swelling, so maybe the skin is puffy or something happened to the muscle in the foot.\\n\\nThe muscle was stitched back together, but we don�t really know how it looked.\\n\\nThere was dried blood on the skin of the foot, so blood must have come out of the foot.\\n \\nIf we were to zoom in on the injured and healed/uninjured foot, do you think we would see anything different than with just our eyes?\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat did you notice was common in how other people represented the different parts of the foot and their interactions in the injured foot compared to the healed/uninjured foot?\\n \\nWe had gaps/holes/breaks between the bone/skin/muscle in the injured foot, but they were connected in the healed/uninjured foot.\\n \\nIs this something everyone showed?\\n \\n\\n \\nOK, we have a model for the foot right after the injury and a model for the foot when it�s fully healed. If we could see what happens over the 4 months it took for this person�s foot to heal, what do you think we would see during the healing process?\\n \\nWe saw swelling, and then it went down, but we don�t really know why.\\n\\nWe would see the skin growing back together or closing up somehow.\\n\\nWe might see a scab or scar on the skin.\\n\\nWe would see the bone lined back up, and the crack in the bone would be filled in.\\n \\nWhat do you think was happening inside the body to cause those events?\\n \\n \\n\\n10\\t� PREPARE FOR HOME LEARNING ABOUT RELATED PHENOMENA\\t2 min\\n\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nFraming students� families and communities as legitimate funds of knowledge serves multiple purposes. It can (1) help students feel like they belong in the science classroom by situating their family and community knowledge as productive resources for science, (2) engage students� families in conversations about what is happening in the classroom, and (3) help students make connections between the science classroom and their everyday lives.\\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n11\\t� EXPLORE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE DISABILITY\\t30 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPrepare to explore differences in how people experience the world. Say, We�ll think about and discuss a few examples of daily tasks to help us explore the wide variety of ways that people complete them. People with and without disability do these things, sometimes with the help of adaptive equipment.\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nMany great novels are written for teens and young adults in which the main character has a disability. In most of these, the focus is not the disability but rather the character�s everyday life experiences. This is a great opportunity to reach out to your ELA counterpart on your team to share what your students are doing in science class, in case any cross-curricular connections can be made. In addition, you may wish to ask if there are novels or other books they would recommend making available to students during this unit. There is an extensive list of beautifully written novels that will provide students a new way of viewing the challenges faced by people with disabilities, and their common struggles that all students face (such as finding friends). Here are a few:\\n?\\tOut of My Mind by Sharon Draper\\n?\\tRestart,by Gordan Korman\\n?\\tBreak the Mould by Sin�ad Burke\\n \\n\\nExplain that for each daily task, students will have 1 minute to brainstorm in their notebook about the ways a person might complete that task. Then they will share out what they wrote. After students share, you will move to the next slide to show images of adaptive equipment that individuals with disabilities may use as they complete that task.\\n \\n\\nBrainstorm ways people communicate. Display slide S. Give students 1 minute to write in their notebook chart about different ways people might communicate.\\n\\nShare out ways people communicate. Have students share their ideas about different ways people complete the task of communicating. Then display slide T to see images of some ways people communicate, including some types of adaptive equipment. Some of these images will be similar to what the students shared. Explain how the adaptive equipment works and ask students if they have any questions.\\n\\nAdaptive Equipment\\tPurpose\\nAAC device\\tAAC stands for �augmentative and alternative communication.� An AAC device is a piece of technology or even an iPad with software (or an app) that contains a variety of words such as verbs, nouns, and adverbs. The person using the device selects the word (or picture) they want, and the device says the word out loud. This can be done by physically touching the buttons or with eye-gaze technology. They can communicate single words, phrases, and even full sentences. An AAC device may be used by individuals who do not use verbal speech or who need language support. Other tools, such as letter boards, can also be used to communicate.\\nAmerican Sign Language\\tAmerican Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as vocally spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face. It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and hard of hearing and is used by many hearing people as well. Source: https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language\\n\\nGestures\\tGestures are woven into the fabric of our daily lives. You may wave, point, beckon, or use your hands when arguing or speaking animatedly, often expressing yourself with gestures without thinking. However, the meaning of some gestures can be very different across cultures. While the �OK� sign, for example, usually conveys a positive message in English-speaking countries, it�s considered offensive in countries such as Germany, Russia, and Brazil. So, it�s important to be careful of how you use gestures to avoid misinterpretation.\\nFacial expression\\tThe human face is extremely expressive, able to convey countless emotions without saying a word. And unlike some forms of nonverbal communication, facial expressions are universal. The facial expressions for happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust are the same across cultures.\\n\\nBrainstorm ways people perceive the environment. Display slide U. Give students 1 minute to write in their chart about different ways that people might see, hear, or understand their surroundings.\\n\\nShare out ways people perceive the environment. Have students share their ideas about different ways people perceive the environment around them. Then display slide V to see images of some ways people might do this, including some adaptive equipment for this purpose.\\n \\nSome of these images will be similar to what the students shared. Explain how the equipment works and ask students if they have any questions.\\n\\nAdaptive Equipment\\tPurpose\\nEyeglasses or contact lenses\\tPeople who experience nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism may use eyeglasses or contact lenses to correct their vision.\\nMagnifier\\tA magnifier is a tool that makes things appear larger. There are physical handheld magnifying tools as well as digital tools that magnify text on a screen. People with low vision who may not be able to make things out at a typical distance, even with glasses or contact lenses, may benefit from a magnifier.\\nCane\\tPeople who are blind may not see using their eyes, but they do use tools and other senses to perceive their environment. A cane is a tool that blind people can use to perceive any obstacles or hazards in front of them as they move from place to place.\\nHearing aids\\tHearing aids are devices used by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to regain a portion of hearing by amplifying sound.\\nCochlear implants\\tA cochlear implant is a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the cochlear nerve (nerve for hearing). The implant has external and internal parts. The external part sits behind the ear and picks up sounds with a microphone. It then processes the sound and transmits it to the internal part of the implant.\\nBraille\\tBraille is a system of raised bumps that allows blind individuals to read text with their fingers. Braille is a code of language and not a language in itself.\\nAlerting devices\\tAlerting devices are assistive devices that connect with doorbells, telephones, and other alarm devices. These devices add a specific alarm based on one\\'s disability. For instance, a deaf individual can have a doorbell that blinks a light instead of making a noise to indicate someone is at the door.\\n\\nBrainstorm ways people eat. Display slide W. Give students 1 minute to write in their chart about different ways people eat.\\n\\nShare out ways people eat. Have students share their ideas as before.

People use wheelchairs for many different reasons. Some individuals use a manual wheelchair that is pushed, or they propel the chair themselves using their hands and arms. Power wheelchairs have motors and joysticks and are controlled by switches. Some wheelchair users control their chairs with switches near their heads or by using other body parts. Some people use their wheelchairs exclusively to get around. Other wheelchair users occasionally walk or use other adaptive equipment to move from place to place in addition to using a wheelchair.\\nStander\\tA stander is a piece of equipment that helps muscles and bones stay strong. Typically, individuals who use wheelchairs for all of their movement use a stander for some time during the day to give them a change of position and help keep their bones and muscles from weakening. The person gets into the stander (with or without help) and safety straps are engaged and tightened.\\nBraces\\tBraces are worn on different parts of the body that need extra support or positioning.\\nProsthetics\\tProsthetics are devices that simulate a body part a person may not have, like an arm or a leg. Prosthetics often work similarly to the body part they simulate.\\nCrutches or walkers\\tCrutches or walkers are devices used to transfer the body�s load from the lower body to the upper body. Crutches and walkers are used when a person\\'s lower body is not completely immobilized, but impaired.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSynthesize and expand our understanding of healing and body function.

Questions will naturally cluster into similar areas. Once students finish sharing, ask them to look at the questions for any additional organization that can be done. Use larger sticky notes to label these clusters. Some clusters that\\nmay emerge include: the parts of the foot (bone, skin, muscle, blood, nerves), recovery, things done to the foot after the injury, healing/repair, when things heal or how long it takes, and so forth.\\n\\nDevelop an initial driving question. Point out that many of the questions are connected to how and why certain things happened in the healing process. Suggest that encompassing them under a single driving question could remind us of how the work on any one question is in the service of all our questions. Ask, Now that we have written our questions, what main driving question should we put at the top of our DQB?\\n\\nFeel free to offer slight changes to students� wording or combine questions. For example, if one student suggests, �How do the parts of the foot work together to heal?� and another suggests, �What is happening inside the foot so the student can walk again?� you can say, I heard one person asking about how the parts of the foot work together and one person asking about what is happening that we can�t see. Can someone combine these into a single question? Once an idea is on the table that meets the criteria and/or looks like the example above, revoice it.\\n\\nIf students struggle to construct a driving question for the unit, propose �How does the foot (or body) heal?� as a single driving question that most of our questions could fit under. Then ask, Does everyone agree on this for our initial driving question?\\n\\nOnce the class agrees on one driving question, write it in large letters on a half-piece of chart paper and hang this banner over the top of the entire DQB. Remind students that we can revise this question as we continue to figure out new things in future lessons.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n15\\t� GENERATE IDEAS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\n\\n \\ncouldn�t walk when these parts were injured.\\n?\\tWe said that we wanted to use a magnifying glass or microscope to look more closely at the different parts.\\n\\nSay, It sounds like in our next class we might want to look more closely at these parts of the foot to figure out more about how they work together for the foot to function.\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RST.6-8.2: Determine the central ideas or conclusions of a text; provide an accurate summary of the text distinct from prior knowledge or opinions.\\n\\nOn day 1, students gather additional information from doctor�s reports and images of an injury, from which they record important events and evidence that those events indicate healing is happening on Evidence for Healing, and then add these to a class timeline.\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off of one another�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question connects to theirs, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n\\nThis lesson�s activities rely on students communicating and articulating their thinking. One tool that supports classroom discussion is the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. This 1-page document can be blown up and printed as a class poster, printed on 8.5-x-11 paper and posted near students� desks, and/or scaled down and taped into students� science notebooks. Reference the sentence starters and encourage students to use them as they communicate. The sentence starters can be especially useful for helping students engage in scientific talk, particularly students who may feel reluctant to contribute.\\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What happens when a bath bomb is added to water (and what causes it to happen)?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\nWe observe different kinds of bath bombs and what they do when added to water. We establish shared norms. We model, at a scale smaller than we can see, what we think happened to the matter that was in the bath bomb and what caused the gas bubbles to appear. We brainstorm related phenomena where adding a solid to water resulted in gas bubbles appearing. This leads us to a broader set of questions that we use to form our Driving Question Board (DQB). We brainstorm possible investigations we could do and additional data sources that could help answer our questions.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-PS1-1, MS-PS1-2, MS-PS1-5,\\nMS-LS1-8\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop a model showing what is happening at a scale smaller than we can see (patterns) to help explain what happened to the matter in the solid bath bombs (matter) and what caused the gas bubbles to appear (matter).\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from our observations of different bath bombs before and after they were added to water in order to seek additional information about what caused the changes (effects) we saw occurring.

Trim all handouts to fit in science notebooks.\\nPrepare two pieces of poster paper for each class for the initial consensus models that you will co-construct. One poster is of the macroscopic view (the side view of the cups) and the other poster is of the microscopic view (with the five circles). You will create the two consensus models for each class. Note that the corresponding colors in both posters match the same parts of the system.\\n\\nOn day 2, for the Initial Consensus model: The colors chosen for the example poster included in the teacher guide for this class model were intentional in order to support students who are color blind to be able to differentiate between the different particles. Since we are working together to figure out what is happening at the particle level and what is different between the particles, it is important that all students can tell the difference between the different particles.\\n\\nAfter your last class on day 3: Merge all the questions together on your Driving Question Board into categories that emerge across all your classes. After (or as) you do that reorganization of the board after this lesson, make a record of all the questions that are on the board so that you can print them out for students to reference in groups of three during class the next day. One way to do this is to take a high resolution photo of the board, and another way is to transcribe the questions on the board.\\n\\nDay 1: Store-bought bath bomb investigation\\n?\\tGroup size: Whole class\\n?\\tSetup\\n?\\tFor each class, place a clear bowl or container with fresh water in the middle of the Scientists Circle.\\n?\\tHave 4 store-bought bath bombs to pass around (reused between classes).\\n \\n?\\tHave 1 additional bath bomb ready to be used up per class.

Watch https://youtu.be/q2UMxYmiUuI for instructions on how to make one of the bath bomb recipes. In addition, see Recipes for Homemade Bath Bombs for complete instructions for preparing these. Each recipe will just fill a mini ice cube tray. This will produce 160 bath bombs from each recipe, for a total of 640 bath bombs. For the investigations in this lesson, you will need enough for one bath bomb per student. The extras that you have left over after Lesson 1, can be stored in ziplock baggies or a sealed container for use in later lessons.\\n?\\tMake four batches of recipe B. Save three batches for Lessons 2 and 5.\\n?\\tMake sure students have access to the following items placed in a common area for this investigation:\\n?\\ttrays or paper plates with different bath bomb samples on them\\n?\\twater\\n?\\t1 splash goggle per student\\n?\\tpaper towels\\n?\\tMake sure you have supplies available so that every student gets at least one of the following:\\n?\\tclear plastic cups (wash and reuse between classes)\\n?\\tdisposable pipettes (can be washed and reused between classes)\\n?\\ttoothpicks\\n?\\tpaper plates\\n?\\tSet up this equipment off to the side, one per group, in case groups request them:\\n?\\tdigital scale and digital thermometer\\n?\\tSafety: There are no safety concerns.\\n?\\tDisposal: All materials can be washed down the drain with cold or warm water.\\n?\\tStorage: Store unused bath bombs in sealed or closed containers.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson is meant to draw out students� prior experiences where they have seen solids dissolving in water (relatively common), and more specifically, where that coincides with the appearance of gas bubbles, which is less common (e.g., Alka Seltzer, dental retainer cleaning tablets). Competing explanations will come up for what happened to the solid and why the gas appeared. We hope to foreground all of these competing explanations in this lesson to provide motivation for ideas to pursue that are largely parallel to the ones that are part of what is planned for lessons in the first learning set of the unit.\\n\\nCompeting explanations include:\\n1.\\tWhat happened to the solid: Some students will likely claim that the solid melted. Other students will claim the solid is dissolved. Assuming that students have developed the 5th grade DCIs related to both melting and dissolving, students should know that mass is conserved in both processes, and that particles of solids can break apart in both cases. They should also know that you have to warm something up (increase its temperature) to get it to melt (change from a solid to liquid). Therefore, you can leverage this line of reasoning to help students argue that we could determine if the solid melted or dissolved in the water by simply tracking the temperature of the stuff in the system before and after we mix them together. That argument can help motivate taking the measurement of temperature of everything in the system, either in Lesson 2 or in Lesson 4, if that didn�t already emerge in Lesson 1. The corresponding slight temperature drop that occurs after adding the solid bath bomb to the water should help provide evidence that nothing is melting in the system.\\n2.\\tWhere the gas came from: Students will identify the bubbles as an interesting aspect of the phenomenon, but don�t initially tend to think of those as being filled with gas. It is anticipated that a small amount of additional facilitation and questioning will be needed to help them make that connection (see the learning plan). One possible source students will suggest from their initial models is that those types of particles were there to start with (e.g., they were inside pockets/cavities within the solid bath bomb before it touched the water and were released when it dissolved). A second possible source other students will suggest is that those types of particles formed when the bath bomb (inter)acted with the water, but were not there to start with, and that some of the substances in the system reacted to form something new. This is an idea that the class will develop, and they will uncover additional evidence over the course of this unit after they eliminate other possibilities. A third possible source that students may raise (but is less commonly suggested) is that the gas is the result of the boiling of a substance that was in the system (the bath bomb in the water). There is no need to resolve whether this is happening until Lesson 5, even if your class has the temperature change data (from this lesson or Lesson 2) to refute this explanation. Boiling is a relatively new phenomenon that is not connected to any DCIs students will have developed around particulate models of matter in 5th grade. Understanding that boiling point is a property of a substance is a middle school DCI. In Lesson 5 of this unit, students will narrow in on potential candidates for the type of substances that the gas in the bubbles could be using. Property data will lead them to determine that it is not the result of any of the original substances boiling.\\n\\nStudents should be ready to make connections to what they figured out about the particulate nature of gases from their work in the OpenSciEd Unit 6.2: How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down? (Cup Design Unit)and OpenSciEd Unit 6.3: Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others? (Storms Unit). We want to use this initial consensus modeling activity to establish what students know about gases (that they are made of particles with lots of space between them). From this, we also want to further elicit what students should know about solids and liquids (particularly water) from a particle perspective. This will help build on what they figured out in the Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit. In particular, we want to help them recall that in those prior units, they figured out that solids and liquids are made of particles closely packed together. We also want to help them recall the idea that it can be helpful to represent different types of substances (e.g., water vs. plastic vs. other gases in the air) by representing them with different types of particles (e.g., different shapes or colors). This is something they did in the Cup Design Unit. We want to help them recall that we can keep track of the same substances (e.g., liquid water and water vapor) by representing the same type of particles (which we often call molecules, as in the case of water) as we did in the Storms Unit. Students should be reminded that these are important connections when developing the consensus model. All of this will culminate in helping students articulate two possible sources for the particles that make up the gas in the bubbles.\\n \\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nIt is not important in this unit that students understand whether dissolving is a physical change or a chemical reaction. It is not important that they figure out what happens to the particles that make up the solid bath bomb as the solid dissolves, beyond the idea that the solid is breaking into little pieces too small to see. It is, however, productive to represent dissolving in the consensus models as �breaking into pieces of matter too small to see and mixing into the water.� Do not try to label those as a specific kind of particle.\\n\\nIn the later part of the unit, students will figure out that the substances that made up the bath bombs were made of smaller particles that are atoms. If that idea is introduced by some students, you can, of course, record it, but don�t offer any more feedback regarding this possibility versus other ideas that are raised. Do not introduce the idea of atoms making up matter in this lesson, as this is the idea that is new in the middle school grade band. This unit is where that idea is developed for the first time in OpenSciEd, and later lessons will support students in constructing propositions for the idea of atoms making up substances according to the line of evidence they accumulate up to that point in the unit. In addition, though students will be modeling what happens when substances go through a chemical reaction (that the molecules break apart and the atoms rearrange to form a new molecule), the mechanisms underlying how this happens with bonds between atoms breaking apart and the different parts of the atom are above grade band.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE BATH BOMBS AND PREPARE FOR STORE-BOUGHT BATH BOMB INVESTIGATION\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: Store-bought bath bomb investigation, science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\nIntroduce the context of how you got some �store-bought� bath bombs. If someone ordered bath bombs for you and you test one before class, then you can say something like this to introduce the bath bombs you are about to show them, I recently got something from the store called a bath bomb. I tried it at home (or school) and found it did something pretty interesting. Have you heard of these? What do you know about them? What are your experiences with bath bombs?\\n\\nDisplay slide A. Allow a couple of minutes for students to turn and talk with a partner about the questions on the slide.\\n?\\tHave you heard of bath bombs before? What is your experience with bath bombs?\\n?\\tWhat do you predict will happen when the bath bomb from the store is placed in a bowl of water?\\n\\nHelp students prepare for the first investigation. Bring the class back together. Hold up a sample bath bomb and introduce what we plan to do with it next, saying, The directions on the package suggest that they are fun to add to water. Let�s get ready to take some observations of the bath bombs I got from the store before and after we add one to some water.\\n\\nPrepare science notebooks to record noticings and wonderings. Display slide B. Have students title a new page in their notebooks and make a T-chart below the title to record what they notice and wonder about the bath bomb.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� CARRY OUT OUR STORE-BOUGHT BATH BOMB INVESTIGATION\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Store-bought bath bomb investigation, science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\nPass some bath bombs around the circle. Hand out four store-bought bath bombs, starting them at different parts of the circle, and have students pass them around in the same direction (e.g., to their right). Tell students to take no more than 20 seconds for each bath bomb before passing it on, and then record anything they notice and wonder about it.\\n\\nWhen one of the bath bombs gets back to you, say that you are going to collect all the bath bombs in a minute and then will put one of them in the bowl of water for everyone to watch together, so that each person can add to their noticings and wonderings. To confirm that everyone has examined the bath bombs first-hand, take a show of hands of who has examined them before collecting them.\\n\\nPrepare to add the bath bomb to water. Say, Think for a minute about whether there is any additional data you want us to collect before I put the bath bomb in the water.\\n\\nAsk for any additional suggestions. Have a thermometer available or scale at a table some distance away from the circle, in case students ask for it. Only use these devices if students suggest the idea of using them now, but don�t suggest either of these devices yet if they don�t.\\n\\nAs the class is making observations of the bath bomb in the water, ask questions to encourage students to make detailed observations. Some suggested prompts to push students to make multiple observations:\\n?\\tWhat are some things you see happening to the bath bomb?\\n?\\tWhat are some things you see happening to the water?\\n \\n?\\tWhat kinds of observations do you hear?\\n?\\tFor those of you closer to the bowl, do you notice any odors?\\n?\\tWould a volunteer nearer to the bowl be willing to feel the liquid and tell us what they observe?\\n\\nIf other students wish to make observations about whether they can smell anything but they aren�t close enough, encourage the closer students to move around so others can have a chance, or if the surface the bowl is on is smooth enough maybe carefully push the bowl around the circle so more than one student can make these close up observations (like smell, what it looks like, what it feels like).\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� OBSERVE HOMEMADE BATH BOMB INVESTIGATIONS\\t1O min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUsing four different recipes gives students a chance to compare and discuss their observations with classmates, and allows the class to investigate a wide variety of substances when considering properties of matter.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nOffering students supplies to choose from in planning what data they wish to collect and what observations they wish to make\\n \\nprovides them the opportunity to decide what they think will be the most important data to collect. Though the lesson is written for small groups to decide together how to set up a data table for the bath bomb investigation, an alternative to this could be to allow each student to individually decide what data they want to collect based on the materials available to them. Not all students need to do the same observations since multiple students across the class will be investigating the same bath bombs and as a result the class should have a wide range of data for each of the four homemade bath bombs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\t� REPORT PATTERNS IN THE PHENOMENA AND DEVELOP INITIAL MODELS AND EXPLANATIONS\\t18 min\\n\\n \\nReporting patterns in the whole-group discussion.

Pass out a copy of What Happens to a Bath Bomb When Put in Water? Give\\nstudents 3 minutes to do this.\\n\\nDevelop an initial model. Pause student work. Display slide H. Orchestrate the labeling of their drawing on What Happens to a Bath Bomb When Put in Water?, in concert as a class, as outlined on slide H. Ask all students to point to the part of their model where each of these are represented. When you see each student doing that, ask them to draw an arrow pointing to that location and label the arrow with the corresponding letter (A through D):\\nA.\\tPointing to a spot in the bath bomb before adding it to the water.\\nB.\\tPointing to a spot in the water right before adding the bath bomb to it.\\nC.\\tPointing to a spot in the liquid remaining in the cup a few minutes after adding the bath bomb to the water.\\nD.\\tPointing to a spot inside of a gas bubble a couple seconds after adding the bath bomb to the water.\\n \\nmaterials). There are phrases in the prompts that ask students to consider related elements of CCCs, particularly patterns (at a particulate scale), matter, energy, systems, and system models.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING ENERGY AND MATTER\\n\\nThe prompt on slide I foregrounds thinking that students have done numerous times in two prior OpenSciEd units in 6th grade, OpenSciEd Unit 6.2: How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down? (Cup Design Unit) and OpenSciEd Unit 6.3: Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others? (Storms Unit). If students ask for clarification about this prompt, remind them that they have used\\n \\nAs students are labeling these, hand out a copy of Initial Model-based Explanation to each student. Don�t have students put this handout in their notebooks yet. You will be collecting them at the end of the period.\\n\\nRead through slide I with the students.? Have students point to where A, B, C, and D are shown in Initial Model-based Explanation. Tell students that in each of the circles in Part 1, they should model what they picture they would see happening if they could zoom in to that part of the system. Give students five minutes to develop this model.\\n\\nUse the model to develop a written explanation. Then pause students again and direct them to Part 2 of Initial Model-based Explanation. Instruct students use their model to help them develop an explanation to answer these two questions on the bottom of the slide:\\n1.\\tWhat happened to the solid bath bomb?\\n2.\\tWhat caused the gas bubbles to appear?\\n\\nLet students know they will have an extra five minutes in the next class to add to their explanations and models. Collect Initial Model-based Explanation before the end of the class.?\\n \\nthis sort of thinking about systems and matter at a scale too small to see in Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit. One unit was about trying to figure out how to keep a drink cold or warm in a container, and the other was about trying to figure out why it hails, rains, or snows sometimes but not others. If this is the first OpenSciEd unit for your students, you may need to explain that the system consists of all the stuff in the bowl of water before the solid bath bomb is added to it, right after it is added, and a few minutes later.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS\\n \\nASSESSMENT\\nOPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.A Develop a model showing what is happening at a scale smaller than we can see\\n(patterns) to help explain what happened to the matter in the solid bath bombs (matter) and what caused the gas bubbles to appear (matter).\\n\\nWhat to look for: This first model students develop on What Happens to a Bath Bomb When Put in Water? is more representative of what they see happening with the bath bomb at a macrosopic level. Therefore the particle level representations may not be included at all, or may be minimally included. They will develop a second model of this at a microscopic, or particle level next in Initial Model-based Explanation. Look for the following elements across their models and explanations to see if they bring these ideas to the table with the prompts for the task as written:\\n?\\tParticle-level representations: Different types of particles in different parts of the system or at different points in time. Students may use other words to describe changes happening at the particle level as well. includings particles speeding up, spreading apart or coming together, colliding, breaking apart from other particles, and mixing in between other particles.\\n?\\tUnobservable mechanisms labeled/referenced for two aspects of the phenomenon: Changes in the solid: through a process such as melting, dissolving, or reacting/interacting with other materials. Appearance of a gas: through a process such as the �release of a gas� from pockets in the solid, evaporation, boiling, or a new substance being produced that wasn�t there before from some of the matter that we started with.\\n \\nAND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nStudents use their models in What Happens to a Bath Bomb When Put in Water? and Initial Model-based Explanation to represent systems and their interactions. In these two models students represent the matter inputs and outputs in an open system (a bowl of water) in their initial models. The two models students develop are designed to foreground accounting for where the matter in the system went to and open up the possibility that maybe the matter in the system wasn�t conserved (even though it was). At the end of this model development, the processes we are trying to track--what we started with (inputs) and what we ended with (outputs)--as well as what happened in between, help lay the groundwork for a representation of reactants vs. products in chemical reactions that students will uncover in the later half of the unit.\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n5\\t� COMPARE INDIVIDUAL MODEL-BASED EXPLANATIONS\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, tape\\n\\n \\nReorient students to the initial models and explanations they developed. If you have collected students� initial model-based explanations, return them to the students and have them secure them to pages in their notebooks (e.g., with glue or tape).\\n\\nStudents review and revise their initial models and explanations from the previous class. Display slide J. Give students 5 minutes to review their models and explanations and add any further details or ideas.\\n\\nPrepare to compare individual model-based explanations. Take a moment to have a short conversation about why we want to look at each other�s models and explanations. Ask students:\\n?\\tWhat can we learn from looking at each other�s initial ideas in their models and explanations?\\n?\\tWhat if someone has different ideas than yours?\\n\\nReinforce students� ideas by saying, We want to use our time to see what other people in the class are thinking and how they are thinking about the cause of the changes we saw in the bath bombs last time. We don�t need to have the same ideas because we all think differently. But we can learn from one another by closely looking at our classmates� work.? We are going to use this time to study their work closely and see if it helps our own thinking.\\n\\nCompare models and explanations in pairs. Tell students that the purpose of the next activity is to compare models and explanations, and use them to note similarities and differences in the way each person is thinking about what happened to the solid bath bomb. This includes why the bubbles appeared, paying particular attention to any changes to the matter in the system that were happening at a scale that is too small to see.\\n\\nShare examples and non-examples of productive comparisons (e.g., a non-productive example would be focusing on the artistry of the drawing or diagram; a productive example would be noting how other students talked about why the bubbles appeared where they did).\\n\\nStudents, working in pairs, will take turns sharing their work. As the group notes similarities between the diagrams, they can make a small check mark on their diagram noting that it is similar to a diagram by another member in their group. If they have a different thing, or the group is confused about part of the system, they can mark those parts of the diagram with a question mark. The groups do not need to achieve consensus at this time.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n \\n\\n6\\t� DEVELOP SHARED NORMS FOR THE CLASSROOM COMMUNITY\\t12 min\\n\\n \\nForm a Scientists Circle. Ask students to assemble their chairs in a circle and to bring their science notebooks and something to write with. They will be in this circle for most of the class session. Ideally, they will need to be able to see the slides and have access to a whiteboard, but if that is not possible, the whiteboard (or chart paper) will be more critical for the rest of the class.\\n\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nIt is important to use this norm building time to begin to cultivate an equitable learning community that promotes trusting and caring relationships. The norms should reinforce the value of diversity of the classroom community members, and equity in the sense-making work they will do together this school year. It is critical that the norms support safe and fair participation and interrupt cultural norms or stereotypes that could make science experiences feel uncomfortable to students (e.g., as being someone who is not intelligent enough to think like a scientist, who has trouble putting their thinking into writing, who cannot do the relevant math, or who cannot share their thinking).\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduce the task to develop an initial class consensus model. Tell students that next, we�ll try to identify areas of agreement and areas of uncertainty across all of our models and explanations. The purpose of introducing the consensus task before talking about classroom norms is to get students thinking about how difficult it will be to get all members of the learning community to agree. It is also important to think about how we want to make sure everyone is included and everyone�s voice is heard.\\n\\nIntroduce science classroom norms. Tell students that before the class moves on to this next step in our work, it is time for the class to set up some norms for how the class wants to work together and learn together in science class. You may want to reiterate productive behaviors you witnessed on the first day of this lesson (Lesson 1) as a way of communicating to students that they were already operating using some positive norms, but they had not yet talked about them.?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDisplay slide K and pass out Science Classroom Norms. (Note: Edit the handout as desired.) Many students may not know what a �norm� is, so tell students that norms are something that we all agree to try and work on so that we have a productive and respectful learning environment. They are similar to rules, but are intended to ensure that all students have a positive learning experience in science class. These are things that we collectively decide upon as a community about how learning will happen best and what we want and need to hold each other responsible for upholding.\\n\\nOn the slide are a set of norms that are a starting point for the class. It is important to talk through each one with students and ask them to provide an example of the norm or paraphrase it. The purpose of this is to develop a shared understanding of each norm. Also, provide opportunities for students to clarify a norm, ask for a modification, or develop a new norm. Allow students to write on their handout if the class decides to change something. Norms are intended to be shared by the students and teacher, so even though a set has been provided, it is just a starting point for students. Making the norms public and visible in the classroom is encouraged. This can be done on a poster.\\n\\nChoose a norm to work on for the rest of class. Display slide L. Ask students to read through the norms one more time and nominate one norm that may be particularly challenging to follow if we are out of practice and require that we must work at it intentionally to get good at it. Discuss a strategy or two that could help everyone adhere to it. Then, before the students end their conversation, ask them to look at the sheet and pick one norm that they personally will work on for the rest of class. They should share the norm with a partner and tell the partner why that norm is important for them.\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL FOR THE BATH BOMB PHENOMENON\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, class norms poster, two partially filled out consensus model posters with titles, circles, labels and keys on them (see materials preparation), chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nDisplay slide N. Let students know that the class is now ready to have a consensus-building discussion.? Tell students, Remember that the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in the initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us to figure out what is happening in the bath bomb phenomenon. We also want to use this time to practice our norms with one another.\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nSince this is our initial consensus model, we want to capture our competing ideas. For example, in the zoom-in circle for the solid bath bomb you might draw particles close together and particles close together with something in between the particles. Use question marks to help show that this is where we have some different ideas. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over others so as not to give away what might be going on in the phenomenon. The class can return to the model and evaluate their initial competing ideas as they gather more evidence throughout the unit.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThe colors chosen for the example consensus poster included here in the\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAsk about areas of agreement. Ask students about what they put in their zoomed-in views that were similar to what other students provided. You should be able to establish agreement around item a above in the �Listen For�s�.\\n\\n\\nWork through the locations in the model in this strategic order:\\n?\\tStart with the zoom in of the bath bomb, in circle A on the top left. Students will likely say that we should model the particles of the solid as being closely packed together. This is how they have modeled solids in Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit. But, there may be multiple areas of disagreement about the homogeneity of the solid that will be productive to capture such as:\\n?\\tIs it made of the same type of particle throughout or different types (based on observations they made of the solid bath bomb)?\\n?\\tIs it solid throughout or are there cavities of trapped gas?\\n?\\tMove to circle B next, bottom left. This zoom-in is likely to have the least controversy around a particle model, due to students\\' prior experiences with modeling liquid water particles as circles in Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit.\\n?\\tMove to circle C next, bottom right. Students will likely say that some of the water is still part of the liquid and that something else is in the liquid that wasn�t before (that makes it cloudy or oily). This should help establish that this liquid is probably a mixture of water and something else. Representing mixtures is something students have done in Storms Unit. This will allow you to establish\\n \\nteacher guide (and in subsequent lessons in this unit) are color blind friendly meaning that students who are color blind should still be able to distinguish between the different shades of colors. If you know you have color blind students, using similar colors and/or using different shapes for each particle will be helpful so they can differentiate between them. There are many websites that have information about what colors are useful for different color blindness. Marker sets that have more color choices will have enough different shades of color that can be used so students who are color blind can still distinguish between the different colors.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nEmphasize to students that they will develop and use models for a purpose in science. Scientific models are dynamic and change as new information is learned, and models need to be �applied� to explain phenomena or design solutions to be considered useful. We develop and use models not just to be able to describe something that happened, but also to be able to come up with a way to explain how and why it happened or to accurately predict what will happen or to engineer a way to make it happen differently. Avoid asking students to simply repeat back an element of a model or even an entire model as an inert fact.\\n \\nthat there is at least a second type of particle mixed in between the water particles.\\n?\\tMove to circle D next, top right. Students will likely say that there are particles spread far apart in the gas. They have modeled air this way in Cup Design Unit and Storms Unit. Where there is likely to be some controversy is what type of particles is the gas made of. Air particles? Bath bomb particles? Something else?\\n?\\tEnd in the middle circle. This is where you will want to capture competing mechanisms for what is happening at a particle level to cause these outcomes. In the diagram below, notice how the competing mechanisms are listed both in the center circle and in a larger poster, so they can be read more easily.?\\n\\n\\n\\nFrame what we accomplished.? Once these ideas are captured in these posters, step back and introduce students to the idea that they just developed an initial consensus model. Explain to students that scientists develop and use models to understand and explain phenomena and to clarify areas of uncertainty and limitations in their current understanding. They then try to refine that model by doing additional\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n \\n8\\t� CHOOSE A FOCAL NORM\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n9\\t� SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA THAT COULD HELP US EXPLAIN\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n10\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the goal of building a Driving Question Board (DQB). Tell students that we are going to capture all of our questions today. The purpose of this work is to use all of our individual questions to determine what it is we want to figure out as a class. To do that, we need to prepare to get all of our questions shared and represented on a single board, which will be called our Driving Question Board.\\n\\nWrite individual questions. Display slide R. Pass out 3 sticky notes and a marker to each student and encourage them to take time to review their Notice and Wonder charts from the bath bomb investigations, their initial models, the class consensus model, and the list of related phenomena. In addition, suggest that students think about questions they have that might help address some of the areas of disagreement in making the consensus model. Tell students that their questions can be related to any of these things as well as any new related phenomena that come to mind. Remind students that it will be part of our class mission to try to answer these questions.\\n\\nGive students the next few minutes to write their questions. Remind them to use a pencil to put their initials on the backs of the cards. If they have time to write additional questions and wish to do so, pass out additional sticky notes.\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.B Ask questions that arise from our observations of different bath bombs before and after they were added to water in order to seek additional information about what caused the changes (effects) we saw occurring. This includes what happened to the matter in the solid bath bombs and what caused the gas bubbles to appear as well as what kind of changes are happening to the matter in examples of other related phenomena we raised.\\n\\nWhat to listen for: Listen for questions that are open (how/why) and testable versus closed (yes/no) in the classroom. Also listen for questions that are specific to the bath bomb and questions that are about related phenomena when solids are added to liquids.\\n\\nWhat to do: Since students will put their initials on the backs of these sticky notes, you will have a few opportunities to take stock of the kinds of questions students ask in this initial lesson after they are posted on the DQB, as well as now when they write them. When students share these questions for the DQB, they will likely only have time to share one. Collect the remaining questions that don�t get posted after the development of the DQB is complete. This record of questions they form today will help you formatively assess their fluency in the practice at the start of this year. If your students are asking mostly closed questions, you can provide a copy of a photo of the questions on the Driving Question Board, and ask them to work on refining three or more of these questions so that they become �how� and �why� questions that can help answer the original question posted as well the original yes/no question. This could be an in-class or\\nhome-learning assignment. For practice (e.g., exit/entrance ticket) the following two questions can be answered at the end or start of any future lessons:\\n?\\tWhat questions were raised for us (now or from the end of the last lesson)?\\n?\\tHow might we investigate one or more of those questions using equipment in our classroom to\\n \\n \\n\\n11\\t� DEVELOP A DRIVING QUESTION BOARD AND REFLECT ON NORMS\\t25 min\\nMATERIALS: extra sticky notes, tape, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nGather in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Display slide S. Instruct students that when they have their questions ready, they need to bring them along with chairs to meet in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Remember that the posters for the initial consensus model and the related phenomena poster should be near where the DQB is built.\\n\\nExplain to students how you will create the DQB.? Use slide T if needed.\\n\\n?\\tThe first student comes up to the DQB with his or her sticky note, faces the class, and remains standing.\\n?\\tThe student reads his or her question off of the note and then posts it on the DQB near the section of the model it is most related to.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question and posts it on the DQB near the section of the model it is most related to. The student also says what other question on the board it relates to and why or how. The student selects the next student.\\n?\\tThis process continues until everyone has had a chance to post a question.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA Driving Question Board (DQB) provides a public representation of the joint mission of the class. Students can share their questions and wonderings with one another, and the visual representation offers another modality for students to access science in the classroom.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOrganize questions into categories. As students share, clustering of questions with similar themes will naturally start. Once students have finished their sharing, ask them to consider, What are some categories or themes we see in the clusters of questions?\\n\\nFive to six themes or categories will probably emerge. Use the categorization that the class suggests to put up a temporary half sheet of colored paper that has that category written on it in that space. If you have a single space for a DQB that will be shared across multiple classes, it is suggested that you will keep these up temporarily for each individual class and then try to merge the categories that other classes suggest too. The example board shown above is from an early pilot of the unit. It is recommended that you create the category of �Gas bubbles� rather than �Fizzy� as shown above. Temperature emerged as a category for these classes, because a few students felt the liquid cooling as the bath bomb dissolved, and some measured its temperature. That category may not emerge in every class.\\n\\nPropose a suggested driving question for the entire board, starting with this one: �Can we make something new that was not there before?� Suggest the question of whether the gas that appeared in the bubbles was something that was there or not to start with. Share that this question seems central to lots of our related questions, which is why you are suggesting this question. Point out that although this is not a how or why question, maybe we can revise it within a few lessons to become one, after we make some progress on this question first.\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n\\n12\\t� CHOOSE A FOCAL NORM AND DEVELOP INITIAL IDEAS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUsing the marker strategy or other object for passing around from student to student allows for equitable sharing among all students and gives them an opportunity to piggyback on another student�s idea. Try to provide time for a second pass through the class because students may have additional ideas as they are listening to other students. If time is short, revisit this activity at the start of Lesson 2.\\n \\nShare ideas for investigations. Display slide W. Reconvene in a Scientists Circle, having each person sit next to their partner. Ask students to share their ideas with the whole group, recording a list of ideas for investigations that will remain public throughout the unit.\\n\\nTo ensure that all students share ideas, say, To make sure we have everyone�s ideas up here, I will pass a marker to the first person on the edge of the circle. The student with the marker should share one idea they have. I will write it up and number it. That student should pass the marker to the student next to them. The second student then shares an idea. If the idea is on the poster already, the student should identify which idea is similar and how it is similar. I will then put another tally mark next to that idea.?\\n\\nIn this way, the marker is passed all around the circle, and all students have a chance to have their thinking represented on this poster. Offer to students that if they have additional ideas that don�t end up on the poster, they can raise their hand after we have heard once from everyone in the class (after the marker makes it all the way around the circle). Emphasize to students that the Ideas for Investigation poster can change throughout the unit as they learn more. If students think of new ideas along the way, ask them to jot them down to add to the poster.\\n\\n\\nA sample poster is shown here.\\n\\nNotice that in both posters, the ideas that were common to both classes of students are the ones that map closely to the work they will be doing in Lessons 2 through 4, which include the following:\\n?\\tLook up the ingredients used to make the bath bombs.\\n?\\tTest the ingredients separately.\\n?\\tTry bath bombs (or the ingredients in them) in different liquids (e.g., the olive oil or baby oil that is an ingredient in the homemade recipes for some of the bath bombs).\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� START PROGRESS TRACKER, UPDATE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS, AND REFLECT ON NORMS\\t20 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� EXIT TICKET\\t10 min\\n\\n \\ndifferent strategies to use to support students in feeling safe and comfortable enough to share their ideas in the whole group. By beginning the unit (and year if you are following the OpenSciEd scope and sequence) with this protocol where everyone�s voice is heard, you are setting the foundation to support the norms that everyone�s voice and ideas are important. This is in addition to the DQB protocol where everyone shares their question by linking into the question that was shared before theirs supports a collaborative learning environment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.7.1.C Pose questions that elicit elaboration and respond to others\\' questions and comments with relevant observations and ideas that bring the discussion back on topic as needed.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through his or her own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off each other�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that are not part of topics in this unit. Over time, students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question. This type of activity gives them practice at doing that.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n \\n \\nLesson 1: How can we heat up food when we don�t have our typical methods available?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n3 days\\n \\n\\nIn this lesson, we see that the flameless heater in a Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) can provide hot food to people when typical cooking methods are not available. We develop an initial model to consider how a flameless heater works, but we also notice that MREs may not always be a viable solution. We decide to design a homemade flameless heater, and we list situations in which that could be useful. After brainstorming criteria and constraints, we create designs for a homemade flameless heater and compare our designs with other people�s. We build a Design Questions Board and gather ideas for investigations that will guide our work as we continue designing.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLCPL Andreas A.

(Bath Bombs Unit) immediately preceding this unit, keep the Word Wall words posted and the Key Model Ideas list in view as students will continue to refer to those in this unit. If you do not still have these available, post a photo of the Word Wall and Key Model Ideas from OpenSciEd Unit 7.1: How can we make something new that was not there before?

Do not post these words on the wall until after your class has developed a shared understanding of their meanings.\\n\\nDay 1: MRE Flameless Heater Demonstration\\n?\\tGroup size: whole class\\n?\\tSetup\\n?\\tYou�ll want to use the same MRE package for each class you teach, so you�ll open it with your first class of the day, then repack it, being sure to include a replacement flameless heater, to �reopen� for each subsequent class.\\n?\\tYou�ll need about 25 mL of water for each class�be sure to let the water sit out well before class begins to come to room temperature.\\n?\\tFor your reference, a video of opening and using the MRE is available at https://youtu.be/-s4Jc_ZJpag .\\n?\\tNotes for during the lab: First check to make sure that the heater is not damaged, or it may not work. Then start the heater as directed on the package and continue passing around the other components of the MRE and spare flameless heater(s) for the class to observe while you�re waiting for the food to heat up.\\n?\\tSafety: Safety recommendations for teachers and students.\\n\\n?\\tNever open and expose the contents of the heater. There is a risk for cross contamination.\\n?\\tEnsure that the lab has engineering controls (eyewash station and shower) available.\\n?\\tWear indirectly vented chemical splash goggles, a nonlatex apron, and nitrile gloves during the setup, hands-on, and take-down segments of the activity.\\n?\\tImmediately wipe up any spilled water on the floor--this is a slip and fall hazard.\\n?\\tFollow your teacher�s instructions for disposing of waste materials.\\n?\\tSecure loose clothing, remove loose jewelry, wear closed-toe shoes, and tie back long hair.\\n \\n?\\tWash your hands with soap and water immediately after completing this activity.\\n?\\tNever eat any food items used in a lab activity.\\n?\\tNever taste any substance or chemical in the lab.\\n?\\tUse caution when working with heated liquids--this can burn skin!\\n?\\tSafety guidelines need to be in place for the hydrogen gas that is generated by these reactions (root killer). Guidelines should include the use of vented containers to avoid the build up of pressure and the elimination of potential ignition sources like sparks and flames. The amounts of hydrogen generated by these reactions do not pose an inhalation hazard. Use appropriate lab ventilation.\\n?\\tDisposal: You can dispose of the used flameless heater in the regular trash but keep the other components of the MRE and repack them to reopen with your other classes. In Lesson 5, you will want to have the MRE available to find the total mass of everything inside an MRE, so repack it and save it for that lesson. However, check the food packages�if they are damaged, punctured, or opened, mass the whole package now and record the mass for students to use in Lesson 5. Then discreetly dispose of the damaged packages (after students have left the room).\\n?\\tStorage: Store sealed components at room temperature as long as indicated on the package.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson (and this unit) builds directly on science ideas that students figured out in the Bath Bombs Unit unit. For instance, when students are observing and modeling the flameless heater in this lesson, they will suggest that some kind of chemical process is happening, possibly a chemical reaction. If they are convinced that this is a chemical reaction (it is, and the package states that hydrogen gas is produced), that is fine. If they are not convinced that it�s a chemical reaction (because we don�t yet know what substances the flameless heater contains to begin with, and they might be skeptical about a chemical process causing something to heat up), that is fine, too. Students will have an opportunity in Lesson 2 to investigate the reactants and confirm that this is a chemical reaction.\\n\\nThis lesson (and this unit) also builds directly on ideas that students figured out in OpenSciEd Unit 6.2: How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down? (Cup Design Unit). For instance, students will model the movement of molecules at different temperatures, indicating an increase in speed at higher temperatures.\\n\\nIn this lesson, students will take a first pass at designing their own flameless heater (on paper). The intent of this first-draft design is twofold: (1) to leverage students� excitement to �jump in� and try putting their ideas on paper after spending time discussing problems and listing criteria and constraints and (2) to motivate the need to gather more-detailed information from testing and data analysis to inform and improve further redesigns.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nWhile students will notice that this flameless heater causes food to heat up, they do not yet name this an exothermic process. That term is added to the Word Wall in Lesson 3, after students also have experience with exothermic and endothermic processes.\\n\\nThis unit will focus a great deal on energy transfer between systems, but in this lesson, students may or may not identify the heater and food as two distinct systems; and they may not yet name energy transfer as the cause of the food heating up. That thinking may begin here but will be further developed throughout the unit, beginning in Lesson 2.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\n \\n\\nTurn and talk about the ways people heat food.? Display slide A. Say, I have a question to get us thinking about a new phenomenon we�re going to explore. Think about all the ways in which people can heat up food inside and outside of their homes. Turn to an elbow partner and start listing ways you know of that we can heat our food.\\n\\nShare ideas about how people typically heat food. Briefly invite students to share what they said or what they heard from their partner about how people can heat their food. It is not necessary to record these ideas. Possible student responses include stovetop, oven, microwave, grill, toaster, campfire, and so forth.\\n\\nIntroduce our question.? Display slide B. Say, You all came up with a lot of ways people typically heat their food. But what if people didn�t have those methods available to them? I have some situations for us to consider in which people were not able to heat up their food in the usual ways. Everyone deserves not only enough food, but good, satisfying food--our physical and mental health depends on it. So, let�s see how these people got hot food when they did not have their typical ways to heat up food. The photos of the situation we are about to see were taken after a natural disaster. In a previous unit, Tsunami Unit, we have thought a lot about unforeseen events that are devastating for those who live through them. I want to remind us that emergency situations can be hard to think and talk about, especially if we know someone who has experienced something like this. So, we will be thoughtful about what we say and how we say it and try to be mindful of keeping our focus on how people dealt with the problem of getting hot food without using the methods you all just mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShow a few images of MREs being distributed. Display slide C. Say, Sometimes there are such big storms that whole cities don�t have power. In this case, Superstorm Sandy knocked out power to New York City. In situations like these, helpers passed out something called Meals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis unit centers around Meals,\\nReady-to-Eat, which include a flameless heater because it can be comforting to have a warm meal, especially in the types of situations where MREs are often used (see Spence [2017] and Lawrence and Bargh [2008]). However, for students who do not have regular access to enough food, designing around how best to heat food might be especially difficult. Before beginning this unit, confirm what supports your school has in place for students who deal with food insecurity.\\n\\nIf you don�t already know which students in your class experience food insecurity, you may want to find out so that you can check in with them (yourself or along with your school�s social worker) to let them know a bit about what to expect in the unit and make sure they are connected with the supports available to them. If, during the course of this unit, a student shares with you that they are experiencing food insecurity, you want to be prepared to listen and refer them to supportive resources. It is important to provide space to normalize conversations about food insecurity. Note that this first lesson will be the only time that actual food\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDisplay slide D. Say, Here are a few more photos of people getting cases of water and of these Meals, Ready-to-Eat in New York City after Superstorm Sandy.\\n\\nDisplay slide E. Say, So in situations like after Superstorm Sandy, people were using these Meals, Ready-to-Eat. They include something called a �flameless heater� that is able to warm food without using electricity, gas, or fire. These photos show people eating warm food, and you can even see in one photo just how hot the food gets. But how does it do that without using the ways we�re used to heating up our food? I have one here, so let�s check it out!\\n\\n \\nis present in the classroom�in future lessons, water will be used as a proxy for food.\\n\\nSpence, C. (2017). Comfort food: A review.

Science, 322(5901), 606�607.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1126/science.1162548\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting empathy and emotions: A unit where its phenomenon is connected to natural hazards is likely to elicit emotional stress from some students, either in terms of the empathy they feel for those affected or from experiencing a natural hazard directly or through the experiences of family and friends.\\n\\nEmotional stress from a disaster can often be great in students who feel they do not understand the situation or that they have no control over the situation. While natural hazards often bring impacts that students cannot control, the aim of this unit is to help students consider how helping people build flameless heaters during and after natural hazard events can be good and to empower them to use what they learn during this unit to respond in ways that can help and comfort their loved ones in the event of a disaster.\\n \\n\\nIf you have students who have traumatic experiences from natural hazards, consider some of the resources found in the Tsunami Unit unit.\\n\\n2\\t� DEMONSTRATE USING AN MRE WITH THE WHOLE CLASS\\t12 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPass around the extra flameless heaters for students to observe up close, keeping the one from the package near you. After a minute, let the extra heaters continue circulating among the group and say, It says here we just need to add water, right? So let�s try this!\\n\\nHeat the MRE�s main entree using the flameless heater. Find the main entree pouch and cardboard sleeve in the MRE package (leave other items in the package for now). Narrate aloud the warning including the part about hydrogen gas. Then narrate aloud the directions of the flameless heater as you follow them. Insert the food pouch, add room-temperature water up to the line, and fold the top over inside the cardboard sleeve. Prop the flameless heater on an angle as directed. Remind students to record in their notebooks their noticings and wonderings about this heating process.\\n\\n \\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\\n \\n?\\tWipe up any water spilled on the floor immediately--slip or fall hazard!\\n?\\tRemind students to never eat or drink food prepared or brought into the lab. There is a risk of cross contamination.\\n?\\tNever tear open and expose the contents of the heater. There is a risk of cross contamination.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBriefly explore the other items in the MRE package. While you�re waiting for the flameless heater to heat up and while the extra heater bags are still circulating around the classroom, remove the other components of the MRE package. Pass them around for students to observe.\\nRemind the students not to open any of the items (because you need to have them available for later classes to observe and/or you cannot eat in the classroom).\\n\\nWatch a video of a person eating an MRE. Display slide G. Say, Our flameless heater here needs a few more minutes to heat up. Since we can�t eat what�s in the MRE here in our class, I have a video of someone who tried one so we can see what he has to say about it.\\n\\nDirect students to continue listing their noticings and wonderings in their notebooks while you watch the video of someone eating an MRE from https://youtu.be/J4SgxOLk9aI .\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL ON OUR OWN\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� COMPARE INITIAL MODELS IN PARTNERS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n5\\t� REVIEW NORMS\\t3 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: Classroom Norms poster\\n\\n \\nRemind students about classroom norms. Display slide K or refer to the Classroom Norms poster in your classroom or in students� science notebooks.\\n\\nSay, In a minute, we will gather in a Scientists Circle, and focusing on our norms will help us make that a meaningful time for everyone.\\n\\nChoose a focal norm for developing a classroom consensus model. Display slide L. Direct students to silently consider the norms and choose one that they will individually focus on for today. Have them give you a thumbs up when they have one in mind. Then, direct students to tell a partner which norm they�ve chosen, why it�s important for them, and how they plan to improve in that area today.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Use classroom norms to support engagement by fostering an equitable learning community that promotes trusting and caring relationships. Classroom norms will be especially crucial in this engineering-focused unit. The norms should reinforce to students the value of (1) the diversity of thought among all classroom community members in pushing our learning forward by sharing responsibility for conceptualizing design solutions, building prototypes, testing our designs, and sharing our data and (2) providing a safe learning environment that ensures fair participation. Students will be giving and receiving feedback that will include constructive criticism. In addition, classroom norms should interrupt cultural norms or stereotypes that could make science experiences feel uncomfortable for some students. If you haven�t already established classroom norms to form this strong and safe classroom culture, take the time to do so here. You may wish to have students help you create the norms, or you may wish to create the norms yourself and then share them with students. If you create the norms yourself, spend some time discussing with students why each norm is important, what it might look and sound like when students are �demonstrating� the norm, and how not following the norm could affect how others feel and interact with the learning community. See the OpenSciEd\\n \\nTeacher Handbook for more guidance on establishing classroom norms.\\n\\n6\\t� DEVELOP A CLASSROOM CONSENSUS MODEL\\t12 min\\nMATERIALS: Initial Model, science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\n\\nListen for these ideas:\\n?\\tThe temperature has increased�the particles have more kinetic energy now than before�and they are moving faster than when they started.\\n?\\tThere is no fire or electricity (battery, plug) involved.\\n?\\tThis seems to be some kind of chemical process and might be/is a chemical reaction (depending on your class).\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� REFLECT ON NORMS AND ASSIGN HOME LEARNING\\t3 min\\n\\n \\nSilently reflect on classroom norms. Display slide N. Say, In the class consensus discussion, you each chose a focal norm to work on. Take a moment to think to yourself: How did you do with practicing the norm you selected to work on?\\n\\nPause for about 30 seconds of individual think time, then ask, How did the class do as a learning community? What did we do well? What could we improve on?\\n\\nAfter another pause to silently consider those questions, invite students to comment. Celebrate successes the class had in this lesson. Also, set a goal for a focal norm for the class to work on the next time you meet.\\n\\nAssign home learning survey. Display slide O. Direct students to record additional questions in their science notebook about MREs and flameless heaters so that we don�t forget them before the next class. Then suggest that we should survey our family and friends about what they know about MREs. Provide students with the link to the electronic survey and ask them to have their family and friends answer these questions before next class.\\n\\nSay, It seems like we have a lot of ideas and questions about MREs and flameless heaters. Often when experiencing something new we look at how others in society value and use them. Before next class let�s survey our family and friends about what they know about MREs and look at how these results can help us understand more about them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nHOME LEARNING OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nHaving students survey their family and friends about MREs, their accessibility, and related phenomena will be used to help connect students with the revelvency of MREs and will be used to help plant the need for a new design solution for flameless heaters.\\n \\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n8\\t� REVIEW COMMUNITY SURVEY RESULTS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, projector\\n\\nSet up new Notice and Wonder charts. Display slide P. Direct students to create another T-chart on the next clean page of their science notebook to record their noticings and wonderings as you project and share the results from the survey.\\n\\nSay, Last class we decided to talk with and survey people we know about their knowledge and experiences with MREs. Let�s look at our survey results to see what new ideas we can learn about MREs from talking to people in our community. Individually record what you notice and wonder in the\\nT-chart you created in your notebook.\\n\\nProject the results for each question. Remind students what each of the questions was asking those that took the survey. Read some of the responses to the short-answer questions from the survey for students as they are recording their observations on their Notice and Wonder chart.\\n\\nSurvey Questions\\n1.\\tHave you ever been in a temporary situation where you did not have access to the traditional ways of heating your food, like in an oven or microwave or over a flame (for example, during a power outage)?\\n2.\\tMeals, Ready-to-Eat, also known as MREs, are self-contained food packages that can be used to provide people with warm food using a flameless heater when typical methods are unavailable. Have you ever used an MRE?\\n3.\\tDo you know where you could get an MRE?\\n4.\\tIn what situations might an MRE be useful?\\n5.\\tWhat are some other things that get hot without electricity or flame?\\n6.\\tWhat questions do you have about MREs and flameless heaters?\\n\\n9\\t� BRAINSTORM RELATED SITUATIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n10\\t� NOTICE AND WONDER ABOUT SITUATIONS DURING WHICH MRES ARE TYPICALLY USED\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\nAdd to the Notice and Wonder chart. Display slide R. Direct students to draw a horizontal line below the writing in their Where Have MREs Been Used Notice and Wonder charts in their science notebook. Have students continue to add and record their noticings and wonderings as you share more information about how MREs are used.\\n\\nSay, By looking at and discussing our survey results we have identified and named a number of different situations in which MREs and flameless heaters could be useful. Let�s look at some additional photos of people using MREs to see what ideas and observations can help us understand more about MREs and our survey results. Individually record what you notice and wonder, then draw connecting lines between these ideas and similar ideas from any noticings and wonderings you wrote based on the survey results.\\n\\nShow photos of other situations during which MREs have been used. Display slides S-Z, reading the captions and allowing students about 30 seconds per slide to record what they notice and wonder in their notebooks.\\n\\nObserve prices of MREs. Display slide AA. Direct students to add to their chart what they notice and wonder about how the cost of a single MRE meal compares to other places at which we might purchase a meal. Students might use the �Wonder� side of their chart to make predictions about why the costs are so different.\\n\\nBriefly share noticings and wonderings. Display slide BB. Invite students to quickly share some of the things they�ve noticed or questions they�ve wondered about while you record them. Have students also share how these ideas might connect to some of the survey results. It is not necessary to have an exhaustive list here, but keep collecting ideas until you have the following on your list (which will be helpful in the development of our design problem):\\n?\\tMREs are expensive!\\n?\\tMREs are not used every day but are helpful for certain situations, such as emergencies (natural disasters, stranded in a car, and so forth).\\n?\\tTransporting MREs to people or places that need them can be difficult (helicopter drops, walking while carrying cases of them and water).\\n \\n11\\t� DEFINE OUR PROBLEM AND PROPOSE A SOLUTION\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, loose-leaf paper (6-8 sheets), chart paper, markers\\n\\nIndividually consider problems with MREs and flameless heaters. Display slide CC.\\n\\nSay, These flameless heaters and MREs are pretty useful, but they�re not perfect. What problems or issues do you see with using MREs with flameless heaters to get hot food to people when they don�t have their typical cooking methods available? Take a minute to jot down your ideas on the next clean page of your notebook.\\n\\n�Pass the Paper� to collect problem ideas. Display slide DD. Distribute a sheet of loose-leaf paper to each of 6-8 random students in the class. Explain the directions for this activity as follows:\\n?\\tWhen you get a piece of paper, write one of your problems with getting hot food to people when they don�t have their typical heating methods available.\\n?\\tAlso, if one of your ideas or a very similar one is already listed on a paper you get, put a check mark near it. We want to keep an informal tally of how many people thought of similar problems.\\n?\\tIf you think an idea that someone else has written is important, put a star near it, also.\\n?\\tAfter you�ve written an idea and checked any others as needed, pass the paper along to someone else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare and post frequently mentioned problem ideas. Display slide EE. Have students gather in a Scientists Circle. Skim through the papers as you collect them, then read aloud and list on chart paper the most commonly written or checked problems. The problems you�ll want to call attention to (because they will be the most helpful in the upcoming steps) are the following:\\n?\\tCost: MREs are expensive!\\n?\\tAvailability: It can be difficult to get them or difficult to get them to people when needed.\\n?\\tEase of use: The directions are confusing.\\n?\\tLack of choice: Choice is limited to foods that come in the package.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConsider why MREs and having warm meals are important. Take a moment to discuss the value of including a heater in a Meal, Ready-to-Eat. Display slide FF.\\n\\nSay, Now that we�ve identified some problems with MREs, let�s consider why warm food is important. Why do you think a heater is included with these meals? Why not just have people eat the food cold? Take a minute to consider these questions, then we can share our ideas with the rest of the class.\\n\\nAfter a minute of individual time to think, invite students to share their ideas about why MREs would be heated before eating.\\n\\n\\nSay, Yes, all of these are reasons why we would want to heat food. MRE flameless heaters do not get the food hot enough to kill bacteria, that�s done when they�re packaged, but researchers have found that warm food can help people feel �warmer� psychologically, not just physically. So including flameless heaters can be important in providing comfort to people as well as providing them with a warm meal.\\n\\nTurn and talk to consider how we might be able to solve these problems. Display slide GG. Direct students to talk with a neighbor about the following questions:\\n1.\\tWhat if, during an emergency situation, all the MREs and flameless heaters were sold out? How could people be prepared if that happened?\\n2.\\tWhat if people couldn�t buy the premade MREs and flameless heaters? What could they do?\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� BEGIN PROGRESS TRACKERS\\t6 min\\n\\n \\n\\nSuggested prompts\\tSample student responses\\n\\n \\nLet�s think about what we just did. Who can summarize what our discussion was focused on just now?\\n \\nWe were talking about the problems with MREs and how we could solve them by making our own heating devices.\\n \\n\\n \\nOK, so what we did there was what engineers do at the very beginning of designing something�we defined our problem. Let�s write that on the left side of our Progress Trackers.\\n\\nThen let�s record what that means for us. What is the problem we�ve identified here?\\n \\nOur problem is that it�s hard for people to get hot food in situations when they don�t have access to the usual ways they heat food.\\n\\nPrepackaged MREs can be helpful, but they\\n?\\tare expensive,\\n?\\tcan be confusing to use,\\n?\\tinclude limited food choices, and\\n?\\tcan be hard to get to people who need them.\\n \\n\\n \\nAfter we defined our problem, we did something else that engineers do; so draw a horizontal line in your tracker under what we just wrote about our problem. What did we do once we had defined the problem?\\n \\nWe said how we could solve it!\\n\\nWe started thinking about how we want to fix those problems.\\n \\n\\n \\nGreat. So on the left side again, let�s write that we proposed a solution. And on the right side, what does that mean for our design?\\n \\nOur solution is to make a homemade flameless heater to help people heat up food when typical methods are not available.\\n \\nSee the example Progress Tracker here, including possible student responses.\\n\\nWhat did we do as engineers?\\tWhat did we figure out that can help us with our designs?\\nWe defined our problem.\\tOur problem is that it is hard for people to get hot food in situations when they do not have access to the usual ways they heat food. Prepackaged MREs are\\n?\\texpensive,\\n?\\tmight be confusing to use,\\n?\\tinclude limited food choices, and\\n?\\tcan be hard to get to people who need them.\\n \\n\\nWe proposed a design solution.\\tWe want to make a homemade flameless heater to help people be prepared to heat up food when they cannot use typical cooking methods.\\n\\n\\nCreate a space to record what we�re doing as engineers. Designate a part of the classroom whiteboard or chalkboard or new chart paper to be the class-level What We Do as Engineers board and title it that way. Tell students, I want us to have a class record of what we�re doing as engineers so we can keep adding to this list and work to figure out what engineers do. So, when we�re working on our Progress Trackers, I�m going to record some ideas on big sticky notes, too.\\n\\nWrite and post large sticky notes that say �We defined our problem� and �We proposed a design solution.� Right now, these could be placed anywhere on the board or chart paper, but as we come back to this list in future lessons, we will reorganize these sticky notes to represent how engineering involves revisiting the same steps or ideas as we revise our thinking, redesign our solution, and work to optimize our design. See the example shown here.\\n \\n13\\t� DISCUSS CRITERIA AND CONSTRAINTS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\nRecall the terms criteria and constraints. Display slide JJ. Say, In the OpenSciEd Unit 6.5: Where do natural hazards happen and how do we prepare for them?(Tsunami Unit) we learned that whenever we want to solve a problem, we need to first define the criteria and constraints of the solution. Let�s remember what those words �criteria� and �constraints� mean. Take a moment to turn and talk with a partner about those words.\\n\\nAfter about a minute of partner talk time, invite students to share what they know about criteria and constraints. Add these words to the Word Wall using a definition and icon or image that your class agrees upon. Examples are shown here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurn and talk about criteria and constraints for our homemade flameless heater. Display slide KK. Say, OK, so what criteria do we have for our homemade flameless heater? What does it need to be able to do? And what limitations will we have for our design? What constraints should we have? Turn and talk with a partner about that.\\n\\nAfter about a minute of partner talk time, quickly have a few students share some of the criteria and constraints they mentioned or heard from their partner. Since you won�t have time for everyone to share, encourage students to signal with a raised hand or similar gesture if they also mentioned or heard a similar idea.\\n\\nPost a public record of possible criteria and constraints. It will be helpful to students when they create their initial designs if they can refer to these criteria and constraints. So, if you do not have time to jot these on chart paper while students share them, do so while students are adding to their Progress Trackers. An example list is shown here.\\n \\nAdd to our Progress Trackers. Display slide LL. Say, We just remembered something else that engineers do�they have to define the criteria and constraints for their solution. But what does that mean for our design? What did you and your partner talk about? Take a moment to add another entry to your Progress Tracker, and use the right column to list the criteria and constraints that our homemade flameless heater should have.\\n\\nSee example Criteria and Constraints chart and updated What We Do as Engineers board.\\n\\nSee the example Progress Tracker, including possible student responses.\\n\\nWhat did we do as engineers?\\tWhat did we figure out that can help us with our designs?\\nWe identified our criteria and constraints.\\tCriteria for our homemade flameless heater\\n?\\tEffective - gets the food hot enough to taste good but not so hot that it burns\\n?\\tEasy to use - clear directions\\n \\n\\n\\tConstraints for our homemade flameless heater\\n?\\tLower cost than prepackaged MREs\\n?\\tAvailable when and where people need it\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL DESIGN\\t6 min\\nMATERIALS: 1 sheet of blank paper (unlined), Initial Classroom Consensus Model, Criteria and Constraints chart\\n\\nIndividually create a design solution. Display slide MM. Have students refer to the classroom consensus model and the Criteria and Constraints chart as they model a design solution.\\n\\nSay, We�ve been considering what our solution needs to be able to do and the limitations we�ll have. So how can we design a homemade flameless heater to help people prepare for different situations? Well, engineers don�t just guess and check to see if a design solution works, they base their designs around their prior knowledge about science ideas. We already began thinking about what science ideas might be at play when we constructed our classroom consensus model. While we might not know everything yet about how flameless heaters work, we can still refer to the classroom consensus model along with our Criteria and Constraints chart to help inform us in modeling a design solution. I�ll give you a blank piece of paper where you can plan your design�use words and drawings to help get your ideas onto paper. Be sure that your design shows how your heater will cause food to be heated up. We�ll work for about five minutes before we share our design in small groups.\\n\\nDistribute blank paper and circulate the room while students work.\\n \\n \\n\\n15\\t� COMPARE INITIAL DESIGNS IN SMALL GROUPS\\t6 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n16\\t� REFLECT ON INITIAL DESIGN SOLUTIONS\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n17\\t� GENERATE QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n18\\t� BUILD A DESIGN QUESTIONS BOARD\\t18 min\\nMATERIALS: sticky notes with questions\\n\\n \\nGather in an Engineers Circle to construct the DQB. Display slide SS. Direct students to bring their questions on sticky notes to the circle.\\n\\nSay, We have a lot of really helpful questions that will direct our work. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have questions similar to some of our classmates� questions. We are going to create a Design Questions Board (yes, you heard me right�it�s still a DQB, but a little different for this unit since we�re focused on this design work). We want to group and organize our questions so that they can help guide our investigations and keep track of what we want to figure out.\\n\\nInstruct students to share their questions, one by one, with the whole group. Explain to students how you will create the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tOther students raise their hand if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThat student selects the next student.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThe first priority during the formation of the DQB is reinforcing a classroom community wherein all ideas are valued. As such, everyone should have a question on the board. Use your judgement on how to press students to form �how� and �why� questions. If students struggle with sharing, encourage them to go public with question(s) as they are, rather than focusing specifically on forming a �how� or �why� question.\\n \\n?\\tContinue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n?\\tIf a question doesn�t fit with any questions that are already on the board, students should create a new cluster.\\n\\nSome of the questions students have might include the following:?\\n?\\tHow can this heater work without flames or electricity? How does it get hot?\\n?\\tWhat substances are in the heater �compartments�?\\n?\\tHow hot should our food get? At what temperature is food comfortable to eat?\\n?\\tIs a flameless heater reusable? (Could we make it reusable?)\\n?\\tWhat materials will we need to make our own flameless heater? Where can we get those materials?\\n?\\tHow much will our materials cost? Do we need a budget?\\n?\\tAre these materials or substances harmful or toxic? What safety precautions do we need to take?\\n?\\tHow can we make our flameless heaters easier to use? Would fewer steps be helpful? How can we clearly communicate our directions to people who will use them?\\n\\nLabel the questions. After all students have shared their questions, you will have several different clusters of questions on the DQB. As a class, decide on �umbrella� questions or topics for the clusters of questions and label them. Then, if you haven�t already done so, post our overarching design question at the top of the DQB: How can we help people build flameless heaters? See the photo of one classroom�s DQB shown here.\\n \\n \\n\\n19\\t� GENERATE IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t7 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Design Question Board\\n\\n \\nGenerate ideas for investigations. Display slide TT. Say, We have so many questions to explore! How could we start to investigate the answers to some of these questions? Title the next page in your science notebook �Ideas for Investigations.� Choose one question or category of questions from our Design Questions Board? and talk with one or two people near you to consider how we might find the answer�what investigation could we design, what data should we gather, and how could we figure this out in our classroom? Keep track of your ideas in your notebook. After you�ve discussed one question, move on to another. We�ll work for about five minutes.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: It will be helpful to students if they can clearly see the question(s) or category of questions they are focused on for generating ideas for investigations. So, you may have students temporarily disassemble the DQB and take sticky note questions or groups of questions to their partnership or trio for reference while they generate ideas. Or, if possible, you might take photos of sections of the DQB and share those digitally with students to look at while they brainstorm.\\n \\n\\n20\\t� SHARE IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t7 min\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What is going on inside M�Kenna�s body that is making her feel the way she does?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n3 days\\n \\nIn this lesson we meet M�Kenna, a 13-year-old girl who started feeling sick all the time. We analyze M�Kenna�s Doctor�s Note and develop initial models to explain what is going on inside M�Kenna�s body and why her symptoms are affecting so many different body systems. After generating a list of related phenomena, we develop a Driving Question Board to guide future investigations.

In this lesson, students are introduced to the anchoring phenomenon�a 13-year-old girl named M�Kenna who feels very sick and is losing weight. Key symptoms are introduced in this lesson, specifically, M�Kenna�s digestive symptoms, weight loss, and lack of energy. The goal established in Lesson 1 is to figure out, �How do interactions inside our body make us feel the way we do?� By the end of the unit students will be able to answer this question in terms of describing how multiple body systems work together to rearrange food molecules through chemical reactions to support growth and provide energy for organisms.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nStudents do not need an understanding of each body system prior to starting this unit. Students will build the pieces they need in order to meet the Performance Expectation MS-LS1-3. This PE emphasizes that the important conceptual understanding revolves around cells forming tissues and tissues forming organs specialized for particular body functions. This unit builds out this pattern with the digestive system first and then generalizes this pattern of organization to other body systems in the second lesson set. A detailed description of what each organ in the body does will not determine mastery for this PE.\\n\\nThis unit directly builds off of the OpenSciEd Scope and Sequence bundle 6.6 Cells and Systems. This unit does not build understanding of what cells are, so students should come in with that previous knowledge.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n?

If you haven�t already, establish norms for whole-group discussions.? If you have already established them, remind students of the norms for engaging in science discussions.\\n\\nChoose a norm to work on today. Direct students to look over their classroom norms . Ask them to silently choose a norm to intentionally work on and monitor in themselves during class to help the learning community grow stronger and more productive for everyone.\\n\\nRemind students of the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. Direct students to the Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout also found in the OpenSciEd Teacher Handbook. Tell students that they will be developing a consensus model together.? Ask them which sentence starters they might want to use to help them talk to one another.\\n\\nBegin the discussion by saying, There was a lot to notice in M�Kenna�s Doctor�s Note. Our goal in this discussion is to share out, with the whole group, what you have NOTICED, what your observations made you THINK might be going on with M�Kenna, and what your observations made you WONDER about.\\n\\nAsk one of the small groups to share one of its Notice-Think-Wonder groupings. Then engage the class in\\nbuilding on the ideas presented by the first group, offering new ideas, or disagreeing with the ideas presented. Some suggested prompts are listed below. You may wish to keep a public record of this discussion on chart paper, in an electronic file (projected on the screen), or by\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nInitial Ideas Discussions allow all students to share their initial thinking on a topic, which supports a classroom culture that values students� prior knowledge and experiences.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nScience discussions are most productive when all students can see and hear one another. It is helpful to establish norms for whole-group and small-group science discussions. See the OpenSciEd Teacher Handbook for more guidance on establishing classroom norms.\\n \\nannotating Map M�Kenna�s Symptoms to Her Body Systems. You may also wish to prompt students to jot down the ideas shared by their peers in their science notebooks.\\n\\nWhen ideas about different symptoms being connected come up during discussion, encourage participants to go public and ponder those ideas with the group.\\n\\n\\nUsing the prompts below, encourage all students to go public with their ideas and support students as they begin to connect their thinking to the thinking of their peers:\\n?\\tCan you say more about that? What do you mean by that?\\n?\\tSo let me see if I get what you are saying. Are you saying that . . .? (Leave space for the original student to agree, disagree, or say more.)\\n?\\tWho can repeat that idea or put it in their own words?\\n?\\tWhat makes you think that?\\n?\\tDid any other groups say something similar? What did you say?\\n?\\tDid any groups say something different? What did you say?\\n?\\tDo you agree/disagree with that? Why?\\n?\\tWho can add on to the idea that we are building?\\n?\\tWhere on M�Kenna�s Doctor�s Note does it say that?\\n \\nYou may wish to have students help you create the norms or you may wish to create the norms yourself and then share them with students. If you create the norms yourself, consider spending some time thinking with students about why the norm is important, what it might look and sound like when students are �demonstrating� the norm, and how not following the norm could affect how others feel and interact with the learning community.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL MODELS\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Initial model, science notebook, tape\\n\\n \\nIntroduce students to modeling. Present slide C and remind students that we decided it might be helpful to capture all of our ideas about what could be going on with M�Kenna in an initial model.\\n\\nDevelop initial models. Hand out Initial model and have students tape it into their science notebooks. Have students individually sketch their initial models.?\\n\\nEncourage students to represent their initial ideas by incorporating ALL of the symptoms, and thus, likely many of the systems beyond the digestive system. Lead a brief discussion on what should be included in the initial models. Use the guidance on slide C to have students explain: �What is causing M�Kenna to have symptoms in all of these different parts of her body?�\\n\\nAdditional guidance to help students in their modeling:\\n?\\tHow could all of these symptoms be happening in different body systems at the same time?\\n?\\tWhy did some symptoms start happening before others?\\n?\\tIt may be useful to think about a healthy person compared to M�Kenna. You may wish to show the differences using different colors.\\n\\nTell students to record questions if they become stuck.\\n\\nAs students work, prompt them to deepen their thinking. At this point in the process, accept all students� ideas but push them to clearly include components and interactions in their models that show what is going on with M�Kenna compared to a healthy person.?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nWhen engaging in modeling, the key should be on explaining the �how� and the �why� of a phenomenon, not just the �what.� To help students focus on the �how� and the �why� for M�Kenna�s case, remind students explain what might be causing M�Kenna to have symptoms in all these different parts of her body rather than trying to �diagnose� her condition.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nWhen developing their initial models, students should focus on what is causing M�Kenna to have symptoms in all of these different parts of her body (effect). At this\\n \\npoint, students will be using the Crosscutting Concept of Cause and Effect below grade level. They do not have enough information to use cause and effect relationships to make predictions about M�Kenna.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\t� SHARE INITIAL MODELS\\t15 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n6\\t� DEVELOP CONSENSUS MODEL IN SCIENTISTS CIRCLE\\t20 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nIt is important to allow all students to share their initial thinking on a topic, which supports a classroom culture that values students� prior knowledge and experiences. Be mindful not to evaluate ideas as �right� or �wrong� in this discussion. The class needs to collect evidence in subsequent lessons to support or refute ideas.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBring students together in a Scientists Circle for a Consensus Discussion.? Present slide G. Tell students that the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us figure out how we might want to proceed in figuring out M�Kenna�s case.\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk, What do we all seem to agree on? What do we disagree on? What are some new ideas that we may want to consider?\\n\\nIt is useful to develop a public record of areas of agreement and disagreement so that students may refer back to their shared ideas. It might be easier to start with what all the models have in common, and then differences will naturally come up.\\n \\nYou will form a Scientists Circle in many future lessons as well. Setting up the norms and logistics for forming, equitably participating in, and breaking down that space is important to do if this is your first time forming such a space.\\n\\nHaving students sit in a circle so they can see and face each other can help build a sense of a shared mission and a community of learners working together. Returning to this Scientists Circle throughout the course of the unit to take stock of what the class has figured out and where they need to go next will be an important tool in helping the class steer the direction of their learning.\\n\\nThis circle will also help build a sense of pride in their work. You may want to inform students that professional scientists also collaborate with each other to brainstorm, discuss, and review their work.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nAdd the word �interaction� to the Word Wall, which will become a useful space for recording a shared meaning of these new words as students develop a deeper meaning of them.\\n\\nA helpful distinction for determining if a word should be added to the Word Wall is to decide if it�s a �word we earn� versus a �word we find out.� A �word we earn� is one we work together to understand through investigation and collaborative\\nsense-making, so we should celebrate our\\n \\ngrowing understanding of the word by adding it to the word wall. A �word we find out� may be encountered through text or media and is defined for us. These words are less important to add to our Word Wall, though they may become a �word we earn� if our understanding of the word grows and changes.\\n\\nThroughout this lesson we will help students develop a deeper meaning for this word as we have students discuss different types of interactions going on inside our bodies. By the end of the lesson, this will have become a �word we earned,� even though its initial definition was presented to us by the teacher. For now, it is on the Word Wall so that we can reference it as needed across this lesson.\\n\\nAn alternative to a Word Wall is to have students note these words in their science notebook through a personal glossary in which they record the meaning of the word and a vocabulary doodle to represent it.\\n\\n \\n\\nRepresent areas of agreement and disagreement in a systems model. Most groups of students will only agree on two things in this model:\\n(1) there is something going on in M�Kenna�s digestive system that is affecting other systems in her body and (2) this may have something to do with what is going into her digestive system or moving from this system to her other systems. Build an abstract representation of this using boxes, arrows, and question marks.\\n\\nSay, It looks like many of us have the digestive system somehow affecting or connecting with other body systems in some way. Maybe there is an interaction there. Anytime there is a connection or relationship between two things, we call that an �interaction.�\\n \\nWhen developing new vocabulary, strategies that may benefit emergent language learners include using student-friendly definitions, making connections to cognate words when possible, and including a visual representation of the word.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nHere, students are practicing modeling with the Crosscutting Concept lens of systems\\n \\nand systems thinking and integrating small pieces of evidence they will use to build disciplinary core ideas over time. Some classes may suggest labeling other known outputs of the model they�ve seen as evidence, such as vomit and diarrhea.\\nInclude these details only if your students bring them up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\t� PROGRESS TRACKER\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis Tracker serves as teacher guidance for what students might say at various points throughout the unit. However, some students may say more and others may say less. It is important that what the students write in the two-column tracker reflects their own thinking at that particular moment in time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion\\tWhat I figured out in words/pictures\\n\\t?\\tM�Kenna has symptoms in all different parts of her body.\\n?\\tWe don�t know what�s causing her to feel this way, and we all have different ideas about what�s going on.\\n \\n\\nWhat is going on inside M�Kenna�s body that is making her feel the way she does?\\t\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\t� SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: chart paper\\n\\n \\nBrainstorm related phenomena. Prompt students to recall some of M�Kenna�s symptoms. You may want to orient students to the Doctor�s Note or the noticings in their science notebooks. Present slide H. After several students have shared out some of M�Kenna�s symptoms, direct students to do a stop and jot in their notebooks about the questions on the slide.?\\n\\nSay, As we are figuring out M�Kenna�s case, it may help to think about other related cases. When have you or someone you know experienced more than one of these symptoms happening at the same time, like M�Kenna? If you knew the cause of the symptoms, was the cause occurring in the same body part as the symptom or in a different part of the body? For example, I had a headache and started to get tired, but what was actually causing it was that I didn�t drink enough water (not actually something going on with my head).\\n\\nHave students turn and talk with a partner about their ideas before sharing out with the whole group (slide I). Accept all student responses. Try to draw out a wide variety of related phenomena. Encourage students to consider how the related phenomena are similar to or different from M�Kenna�s case. Keep a public record of the related phenomena (you will revisit this poster in Lesson 8). You may also want to prompt students to keep a record of the related phenomena in their science notebooks. Some related phenomena may include these things:\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA key element of the Anchoring Phenomenon routine is letting students share their experiences with related phenomena. By doing this, students can connect their diverse experiences with the shared phenomenon that is the focus of the unit.\\n \\n\\n?\\tfood allergies (lactose intolerance, gluten intolerance, and so forth)\\n?\\tinfection (virus or bacteria)\\n?\\tintense exercise or overexertion\\n?\\tasthma\\n?\\tdiabetes\\n\\nWe want students to figure out how M�Kenna�s body is being affected�what�s the underlying cause?�and that the body systems must be interacting or connected somehow. The class should wonder how these different body systems are interacting.\\n\\nConclude the discussion by saying, It seems like a lot of people in our class have experienced symptoms ourselves or know of someone that has experienced symptoms that are similar to M�Kenna�s. These symptoms seem to be happening in all different parts of our bodies and in different body systems! Sometimes, what might have been causing the symptoms was in the same part of our body where we experienced the symptoms and sometimes it was in a part of our body that seemed totally unrelated. It�s like the different parts of our body are interacting or working together in some way. Maybe if we can figure out how M�Kenna�s symptoms are connected, we can figure out how other symptoms in our bodies might be connected, too.\\n\\nBefore we started thinking about these related experiences, what we were trying to figure was just about M�Kenna, �What is going on inside M�Kenna�s body that is making her feel the way she does?� Now, in light of this broader set of things we are wondering about, it seems like we need to modify our question a bit. Perhaps something like, �How do things inside our bodies work together to make us feel the way we do?�\\n\\n9\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA DQB provides a public representation of the class�s joint mission. Students can share their questions and wonderings with one another, and the visual representation offers another modality for students to access science in the classroom. It should be centrally located in the classroom so that it can be referenced and added to throughout the unit.\\n \\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nAsking questions in everyday language allows students to share their thinking or experiences, even if they do not have the appropriate scientific vocabulary yet. This is helpful for emergent multilingual students because by not requiring scientific words at the onset you do not limit their participation in classroom discourse.\\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n10\\t� DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: index cards, tape, markers, science notebook, space for Driving Question Board\\n\\n \\nShare questions to develop the Driving Question Board. Next, begin the process of developing a shared DQB. Say the following prompt to students:\\n\\nWe have a lot of really good questions about M�Kenna�s case and other related cases. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have questions similar to some of our classmates� questions. In order to help us group similar questions, we are going to create a Driving Question Board. We are going to use our DQB to guide our investigation into what is going on with M�Kenna and in our work of figuring out how stuff inside our bodies makes us feel the way we do.\\n\\nInstruct students to share their questions, one by one, with the whole group. Explain to students how you will create the DQB (use slide K\\nif needed):\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tStudents who are listening should raise their hands if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student.\\n?\\tContinue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nFirst and foremost during the formation of the DQB is reinforcing a classroom community wherein all ideas are valued and everyone has a question up on the board. Use your judgement on how to press students to form �how� and �why� questions. If a student struggles with sharing, encourage them to go public with questions rather than focusing specifically on forming a �how� or �why� question.\\n \\n\\nIf the question is a new question and doesn�t fit with any questions that are already on the board, students should create a new cluster.?\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nStudent questions should seek to determine additional information, based on their observations, in order to identify the cause and effect relationships among different organ systems within the body in order to determine a diagnosis. As students share out their questions, work with them to form �how� and �why� questions. For example, someone might ask the question, �What is a stomach ulcer?� Say, That�s an interesting question! I wonder if we can work as a group to add to this question so that we have a �how� or �why� question around our phenomenon, too? Do you want to give it a shot? An example of an expanded question is, �What is a stomach ulcer and how could it cause symptoms like vomiting and diarrhea?�\\n \\n\\nCluster the questions. After all students have shared their questions, you will end up with a DQB that has several different clusters of questions. As a class, decide on �umbrella� questions or topics for the clusters of questions.\\n\\nIf you haven�t already done so, draw students� attention to the scope of all the sub-questions that seem related to figuring out how things inside our bodies are connected. Propose and post this question at the top of the DQB as the driving question for all of the sub-questions under it: �How do things inside our body work together to make us feel the way we do?� Also, have students add the driving question at the top of their Progress Trackers.\\n\\n\\nHere is one example of the kinds of questions students might come up with.\\n \\n \\n \\n11\\t� IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Driving Question Board, chart paper\\n\\n \\nBrainstorm ideas for how to investigate M�Kenna�s case. Now that the class has created a Driving Question Board, tell students that it is time to really dig into the hard work of figuring out what is going on! Present slide L. Ask students the following:\\n\\nWhat investigations could we do to help us figure out what is going on inside M�Kenna and to help us answer our questions?\\n\\nHave students turn and talk about their ideas before sharing out with the whole group (slide M). Make a class record of the investigations. You may also want to prompt students to keep a record of the proposed investigations in their science notebooks.?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nIn addition to generating a list of possible investigations, the primary goal of this step is to develop coherence as we lead into Lesson\\n2. In Lesson 2, students will examine M�Kenna�s endoscopy report. For that reason, it is important that the idea of �looking inside� M�Kenna�s digestive system emerges during this discussion. If students bring up the idea of �seeing� inside M�Kenna�s digestive system, push on the idea by saying, How might we be able to see inside? How could we know more about what is happening inside M�Kenna�s digestive system?\\n\\nStudent questions should incorporate observations made from M�Kenna�s Doctor�s Note, the initial model, and prior knowledge of the phenomena. Their questions should identify additional information required to determine a possible diagnosis for M�Kenna�s condition. After developing the Driving Question Board, they should generate possible investigations that would enable them to answer their questions.\\n \\n\\n12\\t� UPDATE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: Where does this stuff come from?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n3 days\\n \\n\\nWe brainstorm foods we ate that we think come from plants, animals, or other sources. We taste maple syrup and maple sap, foods that we are surprised come from plants and watch a video of sap being extracted from a tree. This motivates us to review nutrition labels for the plant foods we ate. All the plants have some food molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, or fats. We know we get our food from eating, but how do plants get their food? Where is the food in plants coming from? We develop a model to try to explain this and come up with questions to form a Driving Question Board (DQB). We brainstorm investigations to figure out the answers to our questions.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-LS1-6, MS-LS2-3, MS-PS1-3,\\nMS-LS1-2\\n\\n \\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop an initial model to describe the inputs of the system where plants get food molecules (matter).\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from careful observation of food-related phenomena that the class can investigate to explain how plants get matter and energy to make food molecules.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tAll plant foods we looked up nutrition information for have food molecules in them.

Make sure to check the expiration date.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nIn this lesson, students are introduced to the anchoring phenomenon of a maple tree producing sap that humans can drink (eat). By the end of the lesson, students figure out that their agreed-upon inputs for plants include water and perhaps sunlight, which leaves the class wondering, so then where did the food molecules in plants come from? This lesson elicits students� initial ideas about the system of how a plant can come to have food molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, inside of it.\\n\\nStudents may come to this unit with prior knowledge and experiences that can be leveraged. Students might come into the unit thinking they understand how plants get food, namely, plants �make� their food using energy from the sun. Students might even call that process �photosynthesis.� However, this unit pushes students to develop a conceptual model for this process. Where exactly are plants getting the inputs from to make their food? We�and plants�can�t just make stuff out of nothing. So where are the inputs coming from to make the food molecules like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that we find in the foods we eat that come from plants? Where do these food molecules go after they are made in the plant? How can the matter in animals, processed food, and synthetic food, be traced all the way back to plants? What happens to the matter when living things die?\\n\\nThroughout this unit, students will be reminded of what they figured out in the Inside Our Bodies Unit about the inputs and outputs of chemical reactions that happen to food molecules inside the body, related to these two NGSS performance expectations:\\n?\\tMS-LS1-5: Develop a model to describe how food is rearranged through chemical reactions forming new molecules that support growth and/or release energy as this matter moves through an organism.\\n?\\tMS-LS1-7: Develop a model to describe how food is rearranged through chemical reactions forming new molecules that support growth and/or release energy as this matter moves through an organism.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nAs students share their ideas, you may hear them say plants get what they need to grow from soil, rocks, or fertilizer. Although plants take in minerals from the soil, the amount of these minerals is very small compared to carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that make up most of a plant�s structures. Encourage students to share their thinking, but avoid pushing back on any of these ideas at this point in the unit. Subsequent lessons will draw upon students� prior knowledge regarding inputs plants need to make food molecules. Over the course of the unit, students will notice that there are atoms that are in all the food molecule and in all of the inputs. These observations will be used to support students figuring out that carbon is an important atom in the cycle of plant growth and the food we eat. Students will see that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins all have a large amount of carbon in the structure, so carbon atoms make up the majority of a plant�s mass. Plants get carbon from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, not from carbon in the soil. The cycling of nitrogen is beyond the NGSS boundary for middle school and found in the high school grade band. Additionally, the biochemical mechanisms of photosynthesis are beyond the assessment boundary for the NGSS PE, MS-LS1-6.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� EXPLORE THE FOOD WE ATE TODAY\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, 1 plastic spoon, 3 oz plastic cup containing about 15 mL maple syrup, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nExplore what students ate today.

ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSome students might not realize that trees are a type of plant. Make sure you check that all students are making the connection that trees are plants too. If students are not making the connection, ask them to name different types of plants they have encountered in their lives.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHave students Turn and Talk to a student next to them about where the food originally came from�before it got to the grocery store, cafeteria, or vending machine.

Show slide D. While students are tasting the syrup, show the food labels on the bottle of syrup. Students can include ideas from these labels in the Maple Syrup Notice and Wonder chart in their science notebooks. As students record their noticings and wonderings in their science notebooks, walk around the room and quietly ask probing questions.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� WHERE DOES MAPLE SYRUP COME FROM?\\t10 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, computer with projector and sound to show the https://youtu.be/NuY5n61TVtE, Patterns We Noticed chart, markers\\n\\n \\nSay, It seemed odd that this food came from a tree!

SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nInitial questions about a phenomenon are intended to clarify what information is known and not known, and, as is often the case, there are more questions than answers when scientists begin their investigations.\\nDevelop a safe and supportive space for students� uncertainty, and focus on the need to ask and answer questions in order to address the uncertainty that may require the entire unit to resolve.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat patterns do you notice from the maple syrup tasting and the video of tapping a maple tree?\\n \\nThe syrup tasted really sweet.\\n\\nIn the video, it looked like it was winter or spring because there was some snow on the ground and no leaves on the tree.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat did you notice about the inputs and outputs of the system?\\n \\nThe maple syrup was brown, but the stuff coming out of the tree was clear.\\n\\nThe maple sap looked like water.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat are you wondering about now??\\n \\nWe�re not sure.

Recall what we learned about chemical reactions in the body and visualize what will happen to that food over the next 24 hours as it moves through our bodies. Stop and Jot in your science notebook what you think happens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare out initial ideas as a whole group. Have students go public with their thoughts about what happens to the food we eat and drink.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emergent multilinguals: When new scientific words like �food molecules� are introduced, it can be helpful for emergent multilingual students to see a reference to those words on the Word Wall. Add these words to the Word Wall as they emerge in the discussion, rather than before. You can assign a student to create an entry for the Word Wall. and suggest including a copy of the Food Molecule Cards.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nSummarize, So we learned in the Inside Our Bodies Unit that when we eat food, it gets broken down and that we use it for energy, for growth, or for later use by storing it. We also learned what food was made out of. What molecules is food made out of again? Maybe we should take out our Food Molecule Cards from our last unit to double check.\\n\\nReexamine the Food Molecule Cards from the Inside Our Bodies Unit. Show slide I. Instruct students to take out their Food Molecule Cards from the Inside Our Bodies Unit or you can also have the reference Food Molecule Cards ready to hand out to students for convenience, which contains the same image of Food Molecule Cards from the Inside Our Bodies Unit.\\n \\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\nWhat is food made out of according to our Food Molecule Cards?\\tBasically food is made up of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\\n\\n \\nAnd what primarily makes up those food molecules?\\n \\nThey are all mostly made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.\\n\\nWe notice that all of the food molecules are made of mostly carbons in the center of their structure with oxygens and hydrogens, and a few other atoms like sulfur and nitrogen (in amino acids and proteins).\\n \\n\\nSummarize, So basically all food is mostly made up of these molecules that have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. We just ate some food from a tree, which is a type of plant. According to the nutrition label, the maple sap and syrup had sugar�a type of carbohydrate�in it.\\n\\nAdd �food molecules� to the Word Wall. If you kept the card from Inside Our Bodies Unit, repost it now, or create a new one for this unit. An example card is shown here.?\\n\\nContinue the discussion using prompts such as these.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nI understand that we get our food molecules like carbohydrates from eating, but how did the maple tree get its carbohydrate molecules?\\n \\nAccept all responses. Possible responses might include: air, water, soil, eating just like us, sunlight, or making food molecules.\\n \\n\\n \\nNow that I�m thinking about it, it�s kind of weird; we get food molecules from eating, but where are other plants getting their food molecules from?\\n \\nAnswers will vary. Accept all responses.\\n \\n\\n \\nSo, do the other foods we listed that come from plants have food molecules in them too?\\n \\nYes; no; maybe.\\n\\nI have looked at food labels for other foods and they had food molecules.\\n \\n\\nSay, Let�s go back to the list of foods we ate and see if we can organize them into categories before we try to figure out what is in each of them.\\n \\n5\\t� PREDICT WHICH FOOD MOLECULES ARE IN PLANTS\\t11 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, What�s in the foods we eat that come from plants?, chart paper, sticky notes (or index cards and tape), colored markers, markers\\n\\nCombine and categorize the foods our group ate into 3 bins. Distribute half a piece of chart paper to each group. These posters will be reused in Lesson 12. Show slide J. Explain the following:\\nWith your group:\\n?\\tLook at your original list of foods that you individually categorized as 100% from plants, Mixture/Not Sure/Other, or 100% from animals. This time, you will break down the ingredients to make sure you are putting things that we are 100% sure come from the plants and animals into these categories.\\n?\\tWrite each food from your individual list on a sticky note using a marker.\\n?\\tWork in small groups to combine all the sticky notes with foods you ate into three groups: 100% from plants, Mixture/Not Sure/Other, and 100% from animals. (Make sure to get rid of any repeats within your group).\\n\\nIndividually:\\n?\\tUse your 100% from plants category to make a prediction: �Which food molecules would we find in these plant foods?�\\n?\\tRecord your predictions on the handout, What�s in the foods we eat that come from plants?\\n\\nWe will walk through an example before your small groups get to work. Say, So let�s say I had pizza for lunch. Instead of calling pizza a mixture, I�m breaking it down into the crust, tomato sauce, cheese, and olives. Crust�I�m not sure�part of it might be from a plant, but I�m not totally sure, so I�m putting it in the Mixture/Not Sure/Other category. Tomato sauce I�m sure comes from tomatoes, which are plants, and cheese is from milk, which comes from animals, and olives grow on trees, which are plants too.\\n\\nWhile students are working, check to make sure that at least one small group has a food in the �100% from plants� category that contains fat, such as nuts, avocado, beans, or milk. If you do not see one, you could ask, Does anyone like peanut butter cups? Did anyone eat one for dessert? Work with students to put the peanut butter in the 100% from plants category, even if the chocolate gets put in the Mixture/Not Sure/Other category. If there are still no foods that might contain fat on the list, add one from yourself. Go to a small group and ask if you could join their group list. For example, say I had almonds in my cereal this morning, could I join your group list and put my food from plants up with yours?\\n\\nDistribute What�s in the foods we eat that come from plants? and have students tape it into their notebook.\\n\\nMake predictions about which foods from plants have different food molecules in them. Use the �100% from plants� category to make a prediction: �Which food molecules would we find in these plant foods?�\\n \\n \\n\\n6\\t� READ ABOUT BREAKFAST FOOD AROUND THE WORLD\\t2 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Annotating a text can be a helpful alternative for students� action and expression. There are two copies of the reading. One copy is the copy located in the Student Edition behind the reading section. The other copy is a handout to download and print. If you want students to mark the text and answer questions with the reading, they can use the handout version,\\n \\nReading: What do kids around the world eat for breakfast?. Otherwise, students can read the text using What do kids around the world eat for breakfast? in their Student Edition and answer the questions in their notebooks.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an opportunity for students to leverage their own experiences with food in the classroom and emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking and experiences that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too. If students are interested in breakfast food from countries or places not listed in What do kids around the world eat for breakfast?, have them make a list of breakfast foods and they can predict what food molecules might be in the food. Then you can print out or show the nutrition label in class with their group.\\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n7\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\n\\n \\nUniversal Design for Learning: It may benefit students� engagement to add foods from around the world to their group\\'s list. If so, provide them with sticky notes and markers to add the new foods to their 3 bins. There are food labels in Nutrition Labels: What is in food? for each of the foods students read about in What do kids around the world eat for breakfast?. Additionally, if students are interested in a food that is not listed, have 1-2 devices around the room where students can do an internet search for the nutrition label for that food.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\t� INVESTIGATE WHAT IS IN FOOD THAT COMES FROM PLANTS\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nEncourage students to Stop and Jot down any questions that bubble up for them during this lesson. They will be building a DQB at the end of Lesson 1, and we don�t want them to forget any productive questions that arise during this work.\\n \\n \\n\\n9\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL MODELS OF HOW PLANTS GET FOOD MOLECULES\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nSystems and systems models are a focal crosscutting concept for this unit. A system is an organized group of related objects or components. Here we refer to those objects or components as parts. Scientists use models to understand and predict the behavior of systems. The first step in\\n \\nmodeling a system in order to understand it is to figure out the important parts of the system. This allows scientists to study how the parts interact to produce the emergent behavior of the system as a whole. Help students set up their initial models as systems models by identifying the important parts of each system and thinking about how those parts work together (interact).\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nTell students it�s OK if they don�t know the �right� answer when drawing models. At this stage, there are no �correct� ideas to think or questions to ask. All ideas and questions are welcome. The goal of making an initial model is to make their thinking visible to others. Have students try to put any ideas they are thinking down on paper. They can use pictures, symbols, and words. Make sure they label any drawings.\\n\\n10\\t� COMPARE INITIAL MODELS OF HOW PLANTS GET FOOD MOLECULES\\t6 min\\n\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, How Plants Get Food Initial Model\\nShare initial models of the plant system for how plants get food molecules. Show slide O. Students should make a table in their notebooks to record similarities and differences and title it �Comparing our models�.\\n\\nHave students explain their own model to an elbow partner at their table.\\t? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n?\\tEach student talks for one minute.\\n?\\tThen students record in their science notebooks similarities and differences they notice about the ideas represented.\\tDescribe examples and non-examples by using a productive comparison. For example, a similarity might be that both students put\\n \\nwater going into their plants. If one student colored the water blue and another student didn�t color the water at all, that is a difference. But this difference might not be as helpful for understanding as the differences between students� ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\t� REVISIT CLASSROOM NORMS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� DEVELOP A CONSENSUS MODEL OF HOW PLANTS GET FOOD MOLECULES\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n \\nTell students that the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models. Emphasize that knowing where we agree and disagree will help us identify questions we want to try to answer and ideas for investigations we want to pursue.?\\n \\nAs an instructor, you have two goals for guiding the consensus discussion, in addition to the goals listed on slide R. Your first goal is to help students: (1) build a positive culture where putting their ideas out in the public classroom community is valued and (2) to generate a variety of initial ideas to identify that there is a lot we don�t understand yet.\\nHighlight any areas of disagreement. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over others to not �give away� the answer.\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nAlthough it will take a bit more time, help students generalize their specific examples to apply to all plants. When modeling, scientists have to continue mapping specific examples to a more generalized version of what�s occurring. Allowing students to do this work here will help them more broadly develop their practice of modeling.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n \\n\\n \\nSay, So even though we all chose different plants to draw, we can combine our ideas to represent all plants.\\n\\nSuggested prompts\\tSample student responses Was there anything we all had in common in our models?\\tWe saw water in everyone�s models. Did anyone else see water in everyone�s models?\\tYes.\\nWas that water going into the plant?\\tYeah, I had it going into the plant through the roots in the soil.\\nI had water coming down from rain. I had it coming from the air.\\n \\nStudents may have been listing various components of the plant system. It is OK to start pushing them to describe if any of the matter is moving into the plant as an input for food molecules. You can also ask students if there are any components of the system or inputs that are invisible to us with just our eyes that might be important in the system.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n \\n\\n \\nOK, so some students had water come from different places, but everyone had water going from outside the plant to inside the plant in some way. Did I get that right?\\n \\nYeah, that seems right.\\n \\nDon�t worry about fleshing out every similarity or difference. For example, you can say to the group, So it sounds like some people have X, but not everyone is totally convinced\\n \\nSay, I�m going to write the word �input� at the top to represent things we agree are going into the plant. I�ll write �water� with an arrow under the input list, but I�ll put some question marks around how it�s going into the plant because we all didn�t have it entering in the same way. Is there anything else we agree on? Does everyone agree that there were food molecules inside your plants??\\n\\nLook for these three key components in the model: plant, food molecules, water. See the image for an example of what the model might look like at this point.\\n\\nOther areas of agreement might include sunlight and that parts of plants are �above the surface� or �below the surface.� It�s OK if these areas don�t surface at this time.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf students say �leaves� or �roots� are something everyone had, try to push whether this statement is correct. Ask, Did all students really have these specific parts in their models?\\nSample student response: Well, we all didn�t have them in our models, but we think all plants might have some roots and/or leaves.\\n\\nSay, Maybe we can agree that there are parts of plants above and below the surface exposed to light.\\n \\nyet. So let�s put it up with a question mark. Does everyone agree that we�re not totally in agreement about X? Consensus can mean we agree that we�re not in consensus.\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n14\\t� DISCUSS QUESTIONS TO POST ON DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t7 min\\n\\n \\n15\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t23 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, sticky note with question, sticky notes (or index cards and tape), markers, chart paper\\n\\n \\nGather students in a Scientist Circle around the consensus model you created. Show slide U. Find a place where all students can gather around the DQB. Place the Initial Class Consensus Model poster in the center of the DQB. Students should bring their science notebooks and their sticky notes (or index cards with questions).\\n\\nMake sure you provide extra markers and sticky notes (or cards) around the perimeter of the circle.\\n\\nRemind students that our goal today is to capture all of our questions by building a DQB. We can build the DQB on chart paper so we can move it around the class as needed. On a large piece of chart paper or in a part of the room that can stay up for the duration of the unit write the questions, �How do plants get their food molecules? Where are they coming from?�\\n\\nSay something like, it looks like you have a lot of really good questions about where the food molecules come from in the trees that produce maple syrup, in other foods we eat, and from making our models about how and where plants get their food molecules. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have similar questions. We need to listen closely so we can link our questions.\\n\\nCreate the DQB.\\n1.\\tThe first student comes up to the DQB with their index card, faces the class, and remains standing. The student reads their question off the card and then posts it on the DQB near the section of the consensus model or related phenomena it is most related to. (Note: If the model is off to the side, students can post the note/card in a new space on the board/chart paper.)\\n2.\\tThe students who are listening should raise their hands if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n3.\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.?\\n4.\\tThe second student reads their question and says why or how it relates to the previous question. Then the student places their question near the question it most relates to and selects the next student. ?\\n5.\\tThis process continues until everyone has had a chance to post a question. If no one has a question that relates to the one before it, the class can decide to start a new thread.\\n\\nOrganize questions into groups. As students share, questions will naturally start clustering into similar parts of the model system or similar types of questions. If you are using the class consensus model as the backdrop for the DQB, ask students to post questions about specific parts of the system near that part of the consensus model. Once students have completed their sharing, ask them to identify the categories of questions and help them organize them into clusters by giving them a related overarching question or category label.\\n\\nAsk, What bigger questions do the questions in this cluster help answer? Or how could we categorize the questions in this cluster? How do all of these questions fit together?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nHaving the student who volunteered and posted a question pick the next student to share (from those whose hands are raised) is a great way to turn over the pacing and cadence of this group work to the students. Reuse this technique in future Scientists Circle discussions to encourage increased student agency in the classroom learning community. When you do this, take a seat with the students in the circle to position yourself as an equal member of the learning community who is listening, making sense of questions, and trying to figure this out. If you have questions that you want to share with the group, raise your hand and wait for someone to call on you.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nSystems and systems thinking is a focal cross-cutting concept in this unit and has been 4 of the prior OpenSciEd units. As students ask questions, have them reflect on any parts of the plant food system that have few or no questions posted on the DQB. Prompt students to generate more questions in this space so that each important part of the system is to be investigated.\\n \\n\\nHere are some possible examples:\\n?\\tSoil: What�s in the soil? Does soil have protein? Can plants live without soil?\\n?\\tWater: Why do I only have to water my houseplants for them to live? Does water go into a plant�s leaves or just the roots?\\n?\\tPlants: What�s inside plants? Do plants need to eat as we do? Why did the maple tree have sugar flowing out of it? How do plants survive in the winter? Why do plants need fats, anyway? Do plants have fats because they get too many nutrients? Do plants need proteins because they move with muscles as we do?\\n\\nSay, So many of our questions are connected. They all work together to answer our driving question, �How do plants get their food molecules? Where are they coming from?�\\n\\nRemind students that we can revise this driving question as we figure out things in future lessons or find that we have new sub-questions we need to add to the board.\\n\\nAn example of one such driving question board is shown here:\\n \\n16\\t� DEVELOP IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers, Ideas for Investigations poster\\n\\nStop and Jot Ideas for Future Investigations. Present slide V. Have students return to their seats or move somewhere they can work individually. Give students 5 minutes to brainstorm their own ideas for investigations that we could do to answer our questions. As students are doing this, create a new poster, titled Ideas for Investigations. Put this right next to the DQB.\\n\\nIn the last 10 minutes of the period, have students reconvene in a Scientists Circle around the poster so all can see it. Giving the students an option to stand (or sit) at this point might be desirable, as long as everyone can see the poster and the structure of an open circle is maintained so everyone can make eye contact.\\n\\nTell students that you are going to record their ideas and that you want everyone�s idea to be represented. A suggested way to ensure that all students� ideas are shared and get up on the board follows.\\n\\nSay, To make sure we have your idea(s) up here, I will pass a marker to the first person on the edge of the\\ncircle. The student with the marker should share one idea he or she has. I will write it up and number it. Once that student sees that I have almost finished writing it, that student should pass the marker to the student next to them. The second student then shares an idea. If the idea is on the poster already, the student should say which idea is similar and how it is similar. I will then put another tally mark next to that idea. In this way, the marker is passed all around the circle and all students have a chance to have their thinking represented on this poster.\\n\\nIf you have additional ideas that don�t end up on the poster, feel free to raise your hand after we have heard once from everyone in the class (after the marker makes it all the way around the circle). If we run out of time, let�s pick up here in the next class. And if you think of new ideas as we go, feel free to jot them down. We should always be thinking of ways we can add to this list.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn large classes, you may run out of time before all students share out an idea. You can have students brainstorm ideas with a partner instead. Resuming this same activity right where you left off is a natural point to launch the next lesson. So plan to finish this up, if needed, right before the start of the next lesson.\\n\\n\\nNavigate to the next lesson. Once this Ideas for Investigations poster is built, help students realize (and get excited) that they created a joint mission and proposed action plan to guide the work of our learning community for weeks to come as we conduct investigations to figure out how plants get their food molecules.\\n\\nSay, Wow! We have accomplished so much. We now have a broad mission to accomplish as a class, thanks to all the questions you shared and how you connected them. So let�s take a moment to think about how starting with one specific investigation idea could help us make progress on our questions. It seems like we have some ideas about the components of the plant system that we want to investigate. We also have a group of questions around the inputs that plants use and where these food molecules come from. It feels like this would be a productive place to start in trying to figure out more about where food molecules come from.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off one another�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that do not lead to productive investigations. Over time students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question. This type of activity gives them practice at doing that.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: How could buying candy affect orangutan populations in the wild?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-LS2-1, MS-LS2-2, MS-LS2-4, MS-LS2-5, MS-ESS3-3, MS-ETS1-1\\n\\n \\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop an initial system model to describe a phenomenon in which changes to one living component of an ecosystem (cause) affect the other living parts of the ecosystem (effect).\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions that arise from initial observations of populations in an ecosystem to help seek additional information about the parts of the ecosystem and how they interact.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tOne of the main ingredients in many types of candy and cosmetic products is palm oil.

References in this lesson will be revisited in later lessons.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson elicits students� initial ideas about how changes in one part of an ecosystem can affect living things in other parts of the same ecosystem. In this lesson, students are introduced to the anchoring phenomenon�orangutan populations in Borneo and Sumatra (islands in Indonesia) are decreasing. The decline in orangutan populations is connected with increased palm oil production. Palm oil is an oil used in many candy and beauty products. As the demand for palm oil increases, large scale farming operations in Indonesia are clearcutting tropical rainforests to make room for oil palm plantations. Orangutans need certain rainforest trees for food and shelter and can�t survive on the oil palm plantations.\\n\\nWhile palm oil has been harvested by humans for thousands of years in its native habitat in Africa, large-scale palm oil farming operations in Indonesia have primarily increased in the past 100 years where oil palm plants are not native. Throughout the unit it will be important to emphasize the following:\\n1.\\tPalm oil has been harvested in west and central Africa for thousands of years. Be mindful that you may have students in your classroom who come from cultural backgrounds in which palm oil was sustainably harvested as part of their cultural tradition. You may also have students in your classroom for whom palm oil is the primary cooking oil in their homes. Instead of villainizing the palm oil itself, help your students focus on the way we are farming it today on large-scale plantations.\\n2.\\tPalm oil is a far more efficient oil crop compared to the cooking oils that dominate the grocery shelves in the US (see Lesson 2).\\n3.\\tThe cultivation of palm oil in Indonesia has brought many Indonesians out of poverty (see Lesson 4).\\n4.\\tThere are different ways of farming crops that support both biodiversity and humans that we can apply to problems created by any large-scale plantation system (see Lessons 14 and 15).\\n\\nOver the course of the unit, support your students in developing a deeper understanding of the tension that occurs when we farm using large-scale industrial monocrop plantations, like the oil palm ones in Indonesia, and the biodiversity we aim to protect in natural ecosystems.\\n\\nThe unit goal established in Lesson 1 is to figure out: �How does changing an ecosystem affect what lives there?� By the end of the unit, students will be able to answer this question by describing the living and nonliving components in the ecosystem and the interactions between those components.\\n\\nEngagement with the phenomenon on days 1 and 2 sets students up for articulating a system model to explain the problem based on what they understand about it right now. As they model the system to explain the orangutan decline, they will pose multiple cause-effect relationships they believe are important for understanding the problem more fully. Students will then identify gaps or uncertainty in what they understand about the problem, setting them up to ask more targeted questions to investigate in the unit.\\n\\nThis lesson includes an optional extension designed to explore the characteristics of plantations and farms more fully, allowing students to connect to prior knowledge and experiences and more fully develop a historical and modern-day perspective of agricultural practices. It is designed intentionally to bring up similarities and differences across historical and modern-day plantations and farms. This will include the negative and controversial land and labor practices associated with these places. It is important to acknowledge these practices exist and to help students understand that when we choose to discuss these agricultural systems of plantations and farms, we are also acknowledging how the land is being used and who the workers are in these places, both past and present.\\n \\nRegardless of the decision to pursue the optional extension, this lesson includes a discussion in which students consider the use of the term �plantation� and its negative social and historical meanings. Students decide, as a class, to use an alternative word that does not have the same negative social and historical meanings as the word �plantation.\" The materials will default to �farm,� though the class should feel they can use the word they chose together.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThe term �population� is used throughout this lesson. In previous units, students focused mostly on individuals but have not yet been introduced to the idea of populations explicitly. Students may have some familiarity with populations from elementary science as they learned about �kinds of organisms.� At this point in the unit, it is not important for students to have a complete understanding of the word �population.� Students will build this understanding and co-construct a definition for �population� in Lesson 7.\\n\\nIn addition, it is not important for students to have a complete understanding of the different components in the ecosystem and the interactions among the components. Rather, students should focus on sharing their initial ideas about the components and interactions. Students will build this understanding throughout the unit, and will develop a more complete system model for the tropical rainforest and oil palm system in Lesson 11.\\n\\nThis unit directly builds off of OpenSciEd Unit 7.4: Where does food come from, and where does it go next? (Maple Syrup Unit). This unit does not build an understanding of food webs, so students should come in with that previous knowledge. This unit will reinforce the concept of food webs in a new context, particularly in Lesson 11.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE THE PHENOMENON: CANDY BUYING COULD BE KILLING ORANGUTANS\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: Orangutan, chart paper, markers, Orangutans in the Wild video\\n\\n \\nLaunch the unit by meeting the orangutans. Tell students that you recently learned about a concerning situation involving orangutans.? Project slide A and read the headline from The Independent: �Orangutans Could Face Complete Extinction Within 10 Years, Animal Charity Warns.� To introduce students to the orangutans, play the Orangutans in the Wild video from the slide, also located here:\\nhttps://youtu.be/-_u31u6MvY0 . The video provides a brief background on where orangutans live, what they eat, and a natural predator. Give students a few moments to review the information on the Orangutan reference card.\\nStudents may notice that the orangutans only live in Borneo and Sumatra. To orient students to where the orangutans live, present slide B. Explain that Borneo and Sumatra are two of the islands that make up Indonesia. Show students where Borneo and Sumatra are on the Indonesian map. Then, show students where Indonesia is on the world map in the upper-right-hand corner of the image. Point out the United States and the Pacific Ocean on the world map. Finally, zoom back to Indonesia, and then to Borneo and Sumatra again.\\n\\nMeet the cause for potential orangutan extinction. Tell students that, while you found it concerning that the orangutans could go extinct in the next 10 years, you were really concerned about the potential cause for orangutan extinction. Present slide C and read the headline from The Huffington Post, �Your Halloween Candy Could Be Killing Orangutans.� Pose the question, How could whether we buy candy have any impact on orangutan populations in the wild? Give students a minute to think about the question. Then, give students 1-2 minutes to turn and talk with a partner. The purpose of this Turn and Talk is for students to voice their initial ideas about the phenomenon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLead an Initial Ideas Discussion to brainstorm the connection between buying candy and potential orangutan extinction.? Lead a whole-group brainstorming discussion about how our action of buying candy could affect the orangutans. Present slide D and remind them that the claim from The Huffington Post article is: Our candy buying could affect orangutans in the wild. We are wondering, How could buying candy affect orangutan populations in the wild?\\nDraw a quick sketch similar to the diagram on slide D onto a piece of chart paper.? This will be referred to as �Initial Ideas Diagram�Version 1.� Point to the arrow and have students brainstorm what could be happening to connect the two things.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nResearch shows that middle-school students like exotic animals more than local animals (Schuttler, et al., 2019). Through books, television and movies, and visits to the zoo, they may have learned about exotic species more than local ones, thus having more prior experience to contribute. One overall goal in this lesson is to connect what is happening in non-local ecosystems to our personal consumer choices. A second overall goal for the unit is to connect students to their local ecosystems and local flora and fauna. The orangutan in Indonesia is just the initial entry into the unit.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe purpose of an Initial Ideas Discussion is to get students� initial ideas and experiences on the table and to provide a supportive opportunity for students to make sense of what may not be fully formed ideas.\\nRealizing that there are gaps in our understanding can promote curiosity.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n \\n\\nThe sketch similar to the diagram on slide D (Initial Ideas Diagram�Version 1) serves as a scaffold to develop an ecosystem model. In this sketch, one component (candy) is connected with a second component (orangutan) by a line and a question mark. Throughout the first lesson set, this initial model will be progressively developed. The class will work together to include additional components and to agree upon ways to depict interactions between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\t� IDENTIFY WHAT CONNECTS CANDY TO ORANGUTANS\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDiscuss how investigating candy ingredients could help us determine the connection between candy and the orangutans. Project slide E and say, It seems like we need to know more about what is in candy since we�ve done some study of foods in our earlier units. I have a few more resources for us to look at, including candy ingredient lists and information about some of those ingredients. We already have some experience reading these labels, so there may be clues in the ingredients that could be helpful to us. Lead a brief discussion about how investigating more about what�s in candy might help us figure out the connection between candy and orangutans.\\n\\n \\n\\nExamine top candy ingredient lists. Project slide F, with the top candy ingredient lists from several different kinds of candy. Arrange students into pairs or groups of 3, sitting near each other for a brief discussion. Have students examine the ingredient lists for the different types of candy and discuss from where they think the ingredients came (e.g., plants or animals). You may wish to point out that the ingredients listed are the top ingredients in candy and don�t include the ingredients that make up less than 1-2% of the candy.\\n\\nBring students back together as a whole group. Project slide G and discuss, as a class, the main plant and animal sources for candy. Make a list on the board or on chart paper. An example list is provided below.\\n \\nThe revised diagram (Initial Ideas�Version 2) is the second scaffold in model development in this lesson. This revised diagram incorporates two additional components (palm oil and oil palm trees) and includes an initial way to articulate the relationships between the components (e.g., �an ingredient in,� �a substance from,� and �overlap in where these are found�). Later in this lesson, students will work to add even more components and interactions between components to their models. Then, in Lesson 7, students will further build upon this scaffold as they develop the modeling convention that boxes will stand for a group of organisms of plants and animals (i.e., populations) and lines between the boxes represent a connection. Use this opportunity to model for students how to include a new component of the system, connection and interaction between components (line), and a description of the connection (text written on or near the line between two boxes).\\n \\n\\nIngredient\\tSource\\nSugar\\tsugarcane\\nWheat flour\\twheat\\nNonfat milk, lactose, whey\\tmilk/cows\\nCocoa butter, cocoa\\tcocoa\\nPalm kernel oil, palm oil, partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil\\toil palm\\nGround roasted peanuts, peanuts\\tpeanuts\\n \\n\\nCorn syrup\\tcorn\\n\\n\\nExamine the map showing where each candy ingredient is grown. Say, We thought looking at what�s in the candy might help us figure out this connection. Now that we know what the ingredients are, let�s look at where these ingredients are grown, and see if there are any connections to orangutans.\\n\\nProject the map on slide H, which shows the top producing country of each ingredient. You can also hand out the Global Production: Where Ingredients Are Grown map so that students can look at the map on their own if you wish to. This reference sheet is printed in color in the Student Edition but can also be handed out to students to attach to their notebooks.\\n\\nAsk, What connections do you see between what is in our candy and the orangutans? Have students discuss the question, first in pairs and then share their ideas as a class. You may wish to go back to slide B if students have forgotten where the orangutans live.\\n\\n\\nRevise our initial diagram representing the connection between our candy and the orangutans. Return to Initial Ideas Diagram�Version 1 that you sketched on chart paper from slide D and revise ideas about the connection between orangutans and candy to include palm oil.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nNow that we know more, how can we revise our thinking on the diagram? What additional information helps us understand the connection between the candy and the orangutans?\\n \\nWe know that there is an overlap in where orangutans live and where palm oil comes from.\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� EXAMINE DATA ON PALM OIL TREES AND ORANGUTANS\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Land Used to Grow Oil Palm in Indonesia, Orangutan Populations Over Time\\n\\n \\nProbe students for what they think the relationship is between oil palm trees and orangutans. Project slide I and have students discuss the following questions in pairs:\\n?\\tHow could oil palm trees affect orangutans?\\n?\\tIf there were fewer or more oil palm trees, what would happen to the orangutans? Why?\\n?\\tWhat information would we need to support our predictions?\\n\\nAfter discussing in pairs, have students share their ideas with the class. If students don�t know much about the system, they may think that orangutans need oil palm trees to survive�so when they cut down oil palm trees, orangutans lose their habitat. In this case, students might predict that when oil palm decreases, the orangutan population decreases. Press students to provide ideas for evidence that they would need to support their predictions. In most cases, we would need evidence about the palm trees and orangutans over time. Tell students that you anticipated that they might ask for that data, so you were able to find information about the oil palm and orangutans over time.\\n\\nDirect students to the Land Used to Grow Oil Palm in Indonesia and Orangutan Populations Over Time data reference sheets in their student edition. These data sheets contain information about palm oil and orangutans over time. Alternatively, these can be copied and\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Use the palm oil issue as a way to communicate relevance and set a purpose around a shared global concern. While palm oil and the ecosystem it affects could seem far away to many students, creating a personal connection to the anchoring phenomenon/problem through consumer choices and our shared desire to protect tropical rainforests can support student engagement with the science ideas in the unit, making the learning experience more meaningful to students.\\n \\npassed out to individual students as a handout. Say, It seems like we need to pay attention to the oil palm trees and orangutans over time. Let�s take a look at some data about orangutan populations and oil palms.\\n\\nDivide students into groups of 3 to examine the orangutan and oil palm data. Project slide J and prompt students to discuss the following questions in their small groups:\\n?\\tWhat has happened to the orangutans over time? The oil palm trees?\\n?\\tWhat is the relationship between orangutan populations and oil palm trees?\\n\\nDebrief the relationship between orangutans and oil palm trees as a whole class. Have groups share ideas from their discussions.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat is the relationship between the orangutans and oil palm trees?\\n \\nAs the number of oil palm trees went up, the orangutan population went down!\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat was surprising to you?\\n \\nIt was surprising that the number of oil palm trees were going up. We thought that the orangutans needed something from the oil palm trees, so we expected that, since the orangutan population was going down, the number of oil palm trees must have also been going down. But, it looks like there is something else going on, since the number of oil palms are going up!\\n \\n\\nRevisit the Initial Ideas Diagram�Version 2 to summarize the discussion. Point to the Initial Ideas Diagram�Version 2, focusing on the relationship between the oil palm trees and orangutans. Say, Our initial explanation doesn�t seem to explain, yet, what is happening between the oil palm trees and orangutans. Now we need to figure out how an increase in the number of oil palm trees is related to a decrease in the orangutan population. ?\\n\\n\\nBrainstorm additional information. Ask students, What additional information do we need about what is happening in Indonesia? Have students share their ideas with the class. As students share their ideas, jot down notes about the additional information that students are looking for.\\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� ASSIGN HOME LEARNING: PALM OIL SCAVENGER HUNT\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, One everyday product (dish soap, hand lotion, cleaner) that lists palm oil as an ingredient\\n\\n \\nConsider other products that may include palm oil. Say, We know that palm oil is an ingredient in many types of candy, but I wonder, how widespread is it? Could it be in other products as well? Project slide K and have students turn and talk with a partner about the questions on the slide:\\n?\\tWhat other products do you think might include palm oil?\\n?\\tWhere could you look in your home, at school, or in your neighborhood to find such products (so you can check the ingredient lists)?\\nStudents will share a broad range of ideas. Accept all student responses at this point. If time permits, have students share their ideas with the class following the brief partner discussion.\\n\\nAssign the palm oil scavenger hunt. Say, It sounds like we have some searching to do! Spend some time looking for these products in your home, school, or community. You don�t need to move the product or bring it to class�just take a look at the ingredient list. Document what you find in your science notebooks.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nStudents do not need to take a picture of or bring in products that include palm oil. This activity is intentionally designed so that students do not feel embarrassed about using products that contain palm oil. You may wish to allow students to take photos of the products to share with the class or load to a class website, or bring the empty product containers to school. Combined, the students could amass a wide variety of food and cosmetic/personal care products that contain palm oil. This strategy can help make\\n \\nthe problem more relevant and connected to students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n5\\t� FOLLOW UP ON PALM OIL SCAVENGER HUNT\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n6\\t� DECIDE WHAT TO CALL THE PLACES WHERE PALM OIL IS GROWN\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Plantation is used to describe where oil palms are farmed. This term is commonly used today for oil palm agriculture globally and is also widespread in other commodity crop industries, like banana and rubber. The word plantation has historically been used in tropical and subtropical regions of the world where commodity crops have been intensively grown and traded. Even though\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nHave students do a Turn and Talk about the word �plantation.� Display slide M, which shows different images of oil palm plantations. Give students 2�3 minutes to turn to a partner and share what they think of when they hear the word �plantation� and see the images.?\\n\\nElicit from the partners any ideas they would like to share with the class. This is an opportunity to share what they think about when they hear the term �plantation.� Allow a few partners to share their ideas.\\n\\nSay, I was surprised to see that the word �plantation� is still used today to describe where oil palm is grown. To me, it seemed like a word we don�t use anymore because it�s a word that represents a tragic time in North American history. I wondered why they call these places �plantations� instead of �farms,� which is what I tend to call places that grow crops.\\n\\nElicit initial comparisons between plantations and farms by asking, What ideas do you have about how a plantation and farm might be similar or different from one another? Why might we use �plantation� for some places and �farm� for others? Let students share some initial ideas. It�s OK if students are uncertain about the similarities and differences.\\n\\nProvide background on the terms �farm� and �plantation.� Say, From a biological perspective, the terms �plantation� and �farm� refer to land used in similar ways. They are both areas of land in which one or several crops, such as cotton, sugar, strawberries, corn, or oil palm, are grown.\\nHistorically, the term �plantation� referred to a larger area of land used to grow crops, and because the area was so large, they needed a lot of workers to care for and harvest the crops. To fulfill the need for so many workers, landowners enslaved people or hired exploited labor. Exploited labor means they hired people who were desperate for work and willing to work in poor conditions for little pay. The term �farm� has referred to land used to grow crops paying workers a wage, but some of the bad labor conditions still persist on farms, too.\\n\\nDecide what to call the places where they grow oil palm. Say, To help us figure out what is happening to the rainforests and orangutans, we�re going to need to study the oil palm plantations more. Sometimes, we may come across the word �plantation,� and we know more about what these plantations mean now that we�ve done some more investigation. The people in Indonesia that work on oil palm plantations aren�t necessarily slaves, but it is hard work and many do not get paid very much. Because of the negative history of plantations and slave labor in North America, and the negative emotions that the word may invoke, I�m wondering if we could call these places a different word that doesn�t have all the negative historical and social meanings we learned about.\\n\\nGenerate alternative words. Give students time to talk with a partner to brainstorm other words that could be used instead of plantation. Then elicit from students alternative words, which could include farm, orchard, grove, and more.\\n\\nDecide as a class to use an alternative word that does not have the same negative social and historical meanings as the word �plantation.\"\\nUse this word through the remainder of the unit.\\n \\nthis word is used widely throughout the world, in the United States, many students may associate the word plantation with exploited or enslaved labor, particularly in the American South leading up to the Civil War, where the commodity crops of cotton, tobacco, and sugar were intensively grown by enslaved people. The word may surface negative feelings and associations from students; it might also surface distant student attitudes about plantations as �something in the past� that they might not understand or feel connected to.\\n\\nThis activity is an opportunity for students to acknowledge and have a conversation about the meaning of the word both in terms of its biological meaning and its historical and social use with the intent to minimize threat and create a safe space for a discussion of the term. It is also designed to help students choose another word to use in place of plantation that they may feel more comfortable using. These ideas are more fully developed in the extension, Extension Opportunity: Comparing Plantations and Farms.\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THROUGH A SHORT READING\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: Growing Oil Palm in Indonesia or Reading: Growing Oil Palm in Indonesia\\n\\n \\nIntroduce the reading. Project slide N and say, I have a short reading about the oil palm trees and how they are grown and used for palm oil. There may be more information in the reading about the problem we discussed yesterday. Let�s remind ourselves of the different ideas about how increased numbers of oil palm trees could be affecting orangutan populations. Listen for student ideas.\\n\\nForeground the purpose of the reading.? Say, The purpose of the reading is to help us understand why the number of oil palm trees going up might be related to orangutan populations going down. We are trying to gather any other information about what is happening in Indonesia.\\n\\nGive students time to individually read Growing Oil Palm in Indonesia and discuss the questions on slide M in small groups. Alternatively, pass out the Reading: Growing Oil Palm in Indonesia handout if you want students to mark the text and attach it to their science notebooks. After sharing their ideas in small groups, have a few students share their ideas from their discussions.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\nWhy is the number of oil palm trees increasing?\\tThe number of oil palm trees is increasing because farmers are\\ncutting down rainforests to plant oil palm.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: The readability checks for this reading place it at a 7th grade level (i.e., Flesch-Kincaid: 7.5). Students who read below grade level could benefit from more support to decode text, clarify vocabulary, and highlight big ideas during the reading (representation). Consider using partner reading, small group reading with you, or whole-class reading. Spend more time previewing the purpose of the text and encouraging students to note words they do not understand. Include more frequent checks on comprehension as they read. Pause after each paragraph to\\n \\nsummarize the main idea from the paragraph and to discuss any words or phrases that were difficult to understand.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\t� IDENTIFY WHAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE IN OUR MODELS\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n \\nReview the question we want the model to help us answer. Show slide O. The purpose of developing an initial model is to answer the question, How could buying candy with palm oil affect orangutan populations and other populations in the wild? Say, OK, so they�re cutting down rainforests and planting oil palm trees. How could that be causing orangutan numbers to change? And what about all of these other organisms that are also changing? We�re going to try to explain as much as we know about this, but, first, let�s decide what to include in our models.\\n\\nFirst, identify what we already know about what causes lead to the effect of increases and decreases in the number of living things that are living in an area.? Have students make a chart in their notebooks and generate lists of things that could cause a population to go up or down. Have them label their charts with �Causes� in the left-hand column and �Effect� in the top row. Students may work with a partner to generate their lists. You may wish to provide an example to help students get started. An example list is provided below:\\n\\n\\tEffects\\n\\tIncreases\\tDecreases\\nCauses\\tA lot of food and water\\nA lot of space and homes/habitat Making babies/reproducing\\nNot a lot of predators No one is killing them\\tCan�t find food\\nBeing hunted or killed Lose their homes Can�t reproduce\\nToo many predators Pollution killing them\\nClimate change killing them\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nFrame the potential model components as �causes� and �effects.� This will help students to think about cause-and-effect relationships and make clear that often, there is more than one cause for a particular effect.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Using a key can be beneficial to all students for clearly understanding symbols in the model, but these kinds of graphical representations of ideas can also embody representations of key concepts and processes, and support students in using multiple modalities for meaning-making, which is a powerful tool for equitable participation. Encourage students to develop their models using both linguistic resources and multiple modalities when expressing their ideas and reasoning.\\n \\nNext, lead a discussion to help students identify which components would be important to identify in the model. On chart paper, develop an initial list of the living and nonliving things in the ecosystem that we know about right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgree on how we could represent what is happening to each component. Show students how to indicate whether a component is going up, going down, staying the same, or if they are uncertain.\\n\\nNext, agree on how we could represent the interaction between two components. Select two components as an example�the palm kernel and the rats. Show that we can represent an interaction between the two components by drawing a line or an arrow and writing a quick explanation about the interaction, which could draw from what we know about what leads populations to increase or decrease.\\n\\nExamples of the components and interactions are shown to the right.\\n\\nPass out handout Develop an Initial Model: Candy and Orangutans. Have students record the agreed-upon model components that were recorded on chart paper and symbols for model interactions in the appropriate boxes.?\\n\\nPrime students for things to think about before they begin their models in the next class. Students will develop initial models on their own at the start of the next class. Use this opportunity to prime their thinking using a series of probing questions:\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n9\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL\\t15 min\\n\\n \\nWork with a thought partner to develop an initial model.? Project slide P and refer students to Develop an Initial Model: Candy and Orangutans. Assemble students into pairs to develop an initial model to answer the question, �How could buying candy with palm oil\\naffect orangutan populations and other populations in the wild?� Students should develop their own models but can talk things through with their thought partners. Partners do not need to co-construct the same initial model, but they can if they want.\\n\\nKeep the following visible to students:\\n?\\tThe question on slide O, �How could buying candy with palm oil affect orangutan populations and other populations in the wild?�\\n?\\tThe chart with a list of things that cause living things to increase or decrease\\n?\\tThe chart with agreed-upon components\\n?\\tThe chart with agreed-upon conventions for representing interactions\\n\\nBefore students begin modeling, prompt students to think about cause-and-effect relationships as they develop their initial models. As students develop their initial models, circulate to encourage students to use the agreed-upon conventions.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nStudents are working to develop an initial model that can help them explain why orangutan populations are decreasing while oil palm tree populations are increasing.\\nWhen developing their initial models (Developing and Using Models), students think about the individual components of the ecosystem (oil palm trees, orangutans, tigers, rats, snakes, pigs) and the interactions among the components, so that they begin thinking about the ecosystem as a system of interacting parts (Systems and System\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.A Develop an initial system model to describe a phenomenon in which changes to one living component of an ecosystem (cause) affect the other living parts of the ecosystem (effect).\\n\\nWhat to look/listen for:\\n?\\tInclusion of the living components of the system models (such as the oil palm trees, orangutans, rats, snakes, tigers, and pigs) in the systems model\\n?\\tInclusion of at least some of the needs that these livings components have in the system model, such as needs for food, water, air, habitat, or shelter\\n?\\tInitial ideas about what causes the population sizes of living things to increase in number (a lot of food or water, a lot of mates, not very many predators) and decrease in number (very little food or water, can�t reproduce, many predators)\\n?\\tUncertainty about interactions between the living things within the system and the specific cause-and-effect relationships in the system model\\n?\\tUncertainty about which components of the system model are causing increases or decreases in the different population sizes\\nWhat to do: If your students struggle with identifying important components of the ecosystems, refer them back to the class-developed list of ecosystem components. Students may also wish to revisit Growing Oil Palm in Indonesia to find more information about the components in the ecosystem. If students are not sharing their initial ideas about what causes the population sizes of living things to increase or decrease in number, or if students are not sharing their uncertainty about interactions in the system model, encourage them to draw a large question mark and then record their thinking. It may help to refer to these thoughts as �first draft\\n \\nModels). In their effort to use the model to explain the phenomena, students draw heavily on their knowledge of ecosystems developed in previous grade bands (DCI) and must consider the cause-and-effect (Cause and Effect) relationships driving the interactions among components.\\n \\n \\n\\n10\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL\\t25 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: You will form a Scientists Circle in many lessons. If this is your first time forming one, you will need longer than 15 minutes to coordinate it. If your class is familiar with the Scientists Circle, the movement in and out of the circle can happen fairly quickly. Setting up the norms and logistics for forming, equitably participating in, and breaking down that space is important to do if this is your first time forming such a space. Having students\\n \\nPost the prepared chart for the consensus model on the board. The prepared chart paper for the consensus model should include the lesson question and the model stem already drawn onto the paper. Include three boxes with �candy,� �palm oil,� and �oil palm tree� written in each box. Draw an arrow from the oil palm tree box to the palm oil box and another arrow from the palm oil box to the candy box. The class will decide what the arrows mean (shown in blue marker on the example image). The class will label those together during the Consensus Discussion. Start co-constructing additions or revisions to this model by adding additional components and interactions that the class identified in the last step.?\\n\\n\\nSuggested prompts\\tSample student responses\\tFollow-up questions\\n \\nsit in a circle so they can see and face one another can help build a sense of shared mission and a community of learners working together (engagement). Returning to this Scientists Circle throughout the course of the unit to take stock of what the class has figured out and where students need to go next will be an important tool for helping the class take on greater agency in steering the direction of their learning. This circle will also help build a sense of pride in their work. You may want to inform students that professional scientists also collaborate with one another to brainstorm, discuss, and review their work.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nAt the middle school grade-band, students build on their previous understanding of cause and effect to include the idea that there can be multiple causes leading to the same effect. In this discussion, students build on a prior scaffold in which they identified potential causes, and work to trace, in the model, how each cause might contribute to the same effect. Consider using the following prompts from STEM Teaching Tool #41 to further support students� causal reasoning:\\n \\nWhat are some new things that we can\\n \\nSnakes, rats, pigs, tigers, rainforest trees\\n \\nIs this something everyone added?\\n \\n?\\tHow do \\tand \\taffect\\n \\nadd to the model to include any new\\n \\nHow did different people show the\\t\\t?\\n \\ncomponents?\\n \\ninteractions between these different components? Did we all show it the same way?\\n \\n?\\tWhat evidence do we have so far that \\tcauses \\tto happen?\\n \\n\\nWhat is happening to the components? Are their numbers going up, going down, or are you not sure?\\n\\n\\nWhat are some differences in how you showed the interactions between the components?\\n \\n\\nWe know that orangutans and tigers are going down and that rats, snakes, and pigs are going up. We also think that oil palm trees are going up and rainforest trees are going down.\\n\\nI showed the snakes, rats, and pigs eating the dead stuff from the rainforest that was cut down.\\n\\nI showed the snakes, rats, and pigs eating food in the places where oil palm is growing.\\n \\n\\nDo all of those changes happen immediately? Are some of those changes delayed?\\n\\n\\nSo, are you saying that snakes, rats, and pigs might do better in the new environment? Can you say more about that?\\nHow is that different from what \\tis showing?\\nHmm, that�s interesting. Did anyone else show the interactions between the different components differently?\\nAre the connections between the components one-way, two-way, or are we not sure?\\n \\n?\\tWhat do you predict would happen to \\tcomponent if \\t component changed?\\n\\nStudents will revisit these ideas in a later lesson, particularly Lesson 10.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat do we think is causing \\tand\\n\\tto interact this way? What could we write in as the �mechanism� on top of the line showing the connection?\\n \\nFor tigers and orangutans, we could show that tigers are eating the orangutans.\\n\\nFor orangutans and rainforest trees, we could say that orangutans somehow need the rainforest trees, possibly for food, but we aren�t exactly sure yet.\\n \\nWhich of these mechanisms are we sure about?\\nWhich of these mechanisms would we need more evidence about?\\n \\n\\nObserve the cause-and-effect relationships included in the model.? Say, When we initially developed our list of potential causes for populations increasing and decreasing, we noticed that there could be multiple causes contributing to the same effect. Ask, Where in our model do we see evidence of multiple causes contributing to the same effect? Accept all student ideas, as long as students can identify more than one cause contributing to the same effect.\\n\\nSay, It seems like we have a lot of ideas about what is going on in Indonesia, but we have a lot of gaps in our mechanisms. We don�t really know why orangutans can�t just live in the oil palm trees. It sounds like we need to find some more information or data, or perhaps do more investigations to figure this out! One example of an initial consensus model can be found below. It\\'s important to follow your students� ideas during this discussion and not feel strongly tied to replicate this exact model.\\n \\n \\n\\n11\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n \\n12\\t� SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nHave students locate their home learning on related phenomena. Project slide S and have students take out their home learning from the previous day. Remind students that they were asked to think about other examples where changing one component in an ecosystem caused other components to also change.?\\n\\nHave students share their ideas with a partner. After a few moments, have students share their ideas with the whole class. Accept all student responses. Try to draw out a wide variety of related phenomena. Encourage students to consider how the related phenomena are similar to or different from the case of the orangutans and the oil palms. Keep a public record of the related phenomena. You may also want to prompt students to keep a record of the related phenomena in their science notebooks. Some examples of related phenomena can be found in Example Student Ideas.\\n\\nThe shift to related phenomena may feel disconnected from the palm oil problem, and that is OK. In Lessons 5 and 6, students will shift their focus to the problems presented in the palm oil case and how they relate to other similar problems.\\n\\nConclude the discussion by saying, It seems like there are multiple cases that we can identify in which changing one living thing in an ecosystem can affect other living things in the same area. Sometimes the connections seem to be direct, and at other times, they don�t seem direct. Sometimes, the cases involve people, and other times, they don�t. All of these cases sound like they could be connected! Maybe if we can figure out what is going on with the orangutans and the oil palms, we can figure out how the living and nonliving things in these other cases are connected, too.\\n\\nBefore we started thinking about these related experiences, we were trying to figure out �How could buying candy affect orangutan populations in the wild?� Now, in light of this broader set of things we are wondering about, it seems like we need to modify our question a bit. Perhaps something like, �How does changing an ecosystem affect what lives there?� Record this new question at the top of the DQB.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: A key element of the Anchoring Phenomenon routine is letting students share their experiences with related phenomena. By doing this, students can connect their diverse experiences with the shared phenomenon that is the focus of the unit, supporting student engagement in the unit.\\n \\n\\n13\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA DQB provides a public representation of the class�s joint mission. Students can share their questions and wonderings with one another, and the visual representation offers another modality for students to access\\n \\n?\\tour list of related phenomena\\n\\nAfter students have had a chance to review their resources, ask them to generate a list of questions about the case of the orangutans and oil palm, along with the other related cases. Students should record their questions on sticky notes�one question per sticky note. They should write their questions out big and bold�so everyone can see them clearly.\\n\\nGive students several minutes to populate their sticky notes with questions. In order to generate a diverse array of questions, it helps to have students think carefully about the case of the orangutans and oil palm, along with other related phenomena.\\n\\nIf time permits, have students share questions with a partner, first. Ask students to share their questions with a partner to ensure that the questions are clear and productive for the phenomena. The partners should act as critical peers and ask clarifying questions if they don�t understand something. Each student can edit their questions before sharing them with the whole class.?\\n\\nMany of the questions students will have are very strong open-ended questions that can be utilized to help navigate into and out of future lessons in the unit.\\n?\\tIs there another ingredient we can use besides palm oil?\\n?\\tWhy don�t orangutans move away from the rainforest and get a new home?\\n?\\tWhy can�t they use a different plot of land?\\n?\\tWhy are they taking down the rainforest trees?\\n?\\tWhy do palm oil farms attract pigs, snakes, and rats, but not other animals?\\n?\\tIs there a way to make palm oil but not cut down trees?\\n?\\tWhy can�t they use a different kind of oil?\\n?\\tWhy can�t they move the trees to a different place, like a deserted island?\\n\\nOther questions, such as �How many orangutans die every year?,� are interesting but closed-ended. Work to help students broaden such questions into open-ended questions.? Consider some of the following prompts:\\n?\\t�Hm, that�s an interesting question�what made you wonder about how many orangutans die every year?�\\n?\\t�What could that question help you figure out?�\\n\\nIf students are new to open versus closed questions, the Asking Question Tool�Open/Closed Questions is a scaffold that you can choose to support students in developing their questions.\\n \\nscience in the classroom. It should be centrally located in the classroom so that it can be referenced and added to throughout the unit.\\n\\nAsking questions in everyday language allows students to share their thinking or experiences, even if they do not have the appropriate scientific vocabulary yet. This is helpful for emergent multilingual students, because by not requiring scientific words at the onset, you do not limit their participation in classroom discourse.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nEncourage students to use the crosscutting concepts of Cause and Effect or Systems and System Models to help develop questions. You may wish to provide Cause and Effect sentence starters such as:\\n?\\tIn the ecosystem, how did \\tcause\\n\\t?\\n?\\tHow do \\tand \\twork together to affect \\t ?\\n?\\tHow does \\taffect \\tand\\n\\t?\\n?\\tWhat would be the effect if \\t?\\n?\\tWhat feedback loops are causing this system to \\t?\\n?\\tHow can a small change to \\thave a big effect on \\t?\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN\\n \\nDEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nSystems and System Models sentence starters may include:\\n?\\tWhat are the key parts of \\t?\\n?\\tHow do the parts \\t, \\t, and\\n\\twork together?\\n?\\tWhat would happen in this system if you \\t?\\n\\n14\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: sticky notes, markers, science notebook, Driving Question Board\\n\\n \\nShare questions to develop the Driving Question Board (DQB). Next, begin the process of developing a shared DQB. Background about the use of a DQB and guidance about the development of a DQB is provided in the OpenSciEd Teacher Handbook.\\n\\nShare slide U and say, We have a lot of really good questions about the case of the orangutans and oil palm, along with some other related cases. It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have questions similar to some of our classmates� questions. In order to help us group similar questions, we are going to create a Driving Question Board, or DQB. We are going to use our DQB to guide our investigation into what is going on with the orangutans and the oil palm, and in our work of figuring out how changing one living thing in an area could affect other living things in the same area.\\n\\nInstruct students to share their questions, one by one, with the whole group.? Explain to students how you will create the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, and then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tStudents who are listening should raise their hands if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThe student selects the next student.\\n?\\tContinue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n\\nIf the question is a new question and doesn�t fit with any questions that are already on the board, students should create a new cluster.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nFirst and foremost during the formation of the DQB is reinforcing a classroom community, wherein all ideas are valued and everyone has a question up on the board.\\nUse your judgment on how to press students to form �how� and �why� questions. If a student struggles with sharing, encourage them to go public with questions, rather than focusing specifically on forming a �how� or �why� question.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nWhen developing questions for the DQB, students are prompted to review their initial model, paying specific attention to the components and the interactions between the components (Systems and System\\n \\nCluster the questions. After all students have shared their questions, you will end up with a DQB that has several different clusters of questions. As a class, decide on �umbrella� questions or topics for the clusters of questions.\\n\\nExamples of the kinds of questions students might come up with can be found in Example Student Ideas. Here are two examples of DQBs that were developed in field test classrooms.\\n \\nModels) to develop questions (Asking Questions and Defining Problems) about the orangutan and oil palm tree populations in an ecosystem. Developing questions should require students to think about the ecosystem model and important science ideas in the context of the practice of asking questions.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n15\\t� BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR DATA AND INFORMATION WE NEED\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Driving Question Board, chart paper\\n\\nBrainstorm ideas for data and information we need. Now that the class has created a DQB, tell students that it is time to really dig into the hard work of figuring out what is going on! Stay in the Scientists Circle to brainstorm ideas for the data and information we need. Present slide V and ask students, What kinds of information or data do we need to figure out the answers to our questions?\\n\\nPrompt students to use the categories of questions from the DQB to identify the data and information that would help them answer the category of questions. Have students turn and talk about their ideas before sharing with the whole group. Assign each small group a category of questions.\\n\\nHave small groups share out their ideas with the whole group. Make sure that all groups get to share at least a few ideas. Make a class record of the ideas for future investigations and data we need. You may also want to prompt students to keep a record of proposed investigations in their science notebooks.\\n\\nAn example is provided below, and more can be found in Example Student Ideas:\\n\\nCategory of questions\\tData and information that could be helpful\\nWhere can oil palm trees grow?\\tClimate for oil palm trees\\nIdeal temperature for oil palm trees Ideal amount of water for oil palm trees\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\nDiscuss what questions to investigate next. Conclude the lesson by working with students to determine your next steps. Say, We figured out a lot the past few days! We figured out that when the number of oil palm trees goes up, the orangutan population goes down. We think this has something to do with orangutans not having enough food or habitat, or being killed when oil palm trees are planted. It seems like growing oil palm is causing orangutan populations to decrease.\\n\\nDirect students� attention to the DQB and display slide W. Say, We asked a lot of really good questions on our DQB! Which of these questions or clusters of questions do you think we should investigate first to help us understand the problem? Allow students to propose which questions they would like to pursue first. Students will likely feel motivated to think more about palm oil as an ingredient and oil palm farms. In most cases, there will be a cluster of questions related to replacing oil palm with something else. As students share their thoughts about which questions to discuss first, you may wish to read several of the questions from the DQB. Work to develop agreement to pursue the questions about using oil palm as an ingredient first. Summarize by saying, It seems like we have a lot of questions about why people use palm oil in foods and products in the first place, and if there is something else we could use instead, so we could help orangutans. That sounds like it could be a promising solution. Let�s start our investigations there.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RST.6-8.2: Determine the central ideas or conclusions of a text; provide an accurate summary of the text distinct from prior knowledge or opinions.\\n\\nOn day 2, students gather additional information from a reading about palm oil production and use it to determine that it is a crop grown to produce an oil that is an ingredient in many food and cosmetic products.\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking.

We examine headlines that show a �new normal� of increased floods and droughts across the United States and notice that, in both situations, there is a pattern of record heat and rising temperatures. We develop an initial model explaining what could be causing those warmer temperatures and how those warmer temperatures could lead to both droughts and floods.

This document provides an overview of how to integrate ESS3.A more fully throughout the first lesson set with respect to fresh water resources and during lesson set 2 for mineral resources.\\n \\n\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nIn this lesson, students are introduced to the anchoring phenomena�two news clips that tell the story of extreme flood and drought events in two different communities, their own stories of changes in water in their communities, and headlines that show a �new normal� of increased floods and droughts across communities in the United States. This lesson elicits students� initial ideas about what could be causing warmer temperatures and how those warmer temperatures could lead to an increase in both droughts and floods.\\n\\nStudents will come to this unit with prior knowledge and experiences that can be leveraged. Students might use terms like global warming, greenhouse gases, and climate change. However, this unit pushes students to understand the mechanisms behind increasing global temperatures.\\n\\nIt is preferred that students come to this unit with prior knowledge from OpenSciEd Unit 6.3: Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others? (Storms Unit) unit related to these three NGSS performance expectations:\\n?\\tMS-ESS2-4: Develop a model to describe the cycling of water through Earth\\'s systems driven by energy from the sun and the force of gravity.\\n?\\tMS-ESS2-5: Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses result in changes in weather conditions.\\n?\\tMS-ESS2-6: Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of Earth cause patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates.\\n\\nRelevant ideas from this previous work include:\\n?\\tAir particles near the ground get warmed up by the sun, and this energy is transferred from the particles in the ground to the air through conduction.\\n?\\tThe temperature of water or soil increases as energy is added to them/the substance.\\n?\\tAs more energy is added, some water molecules turn into a gas and become water vapor (evaporation).\\n?\\tAs water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and will turn back into liquid. It condenses on dust particles or other things in the air and begins to form clouds and eventually falls as precipitation.\\n?\\tThe role of wind in moving parcels of air around.\\n?\\tWeather is the minute-by-minute or day-by-day variation in the condition of the atmosphere, while climate is longer term (years to centuries).\\n\\nWhen students set up their initial models, push students to bring this prior knowledge to their modeling work and to push their models to think about how temperature could affect what they already know about the system.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThe terms �climate change� and �global warming� will likely be used throughout this lesson. At this point in the unit, it is not important for students to have a complete understanding of these words, and most likely, many students will use them without a full understanding. This is OK for this lesson as students will develop a fuller understanding of both terms across the unit.\\n\\nIn addition, it is not important for students to have a complete understanding of the different components and interactions in the system as students will most fully build a water system model in Lesson Set 1 and a carbon system model in Lesson Set 2.\\n \\n\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE TWO STORIES ABOUT FLOODS AND DROUGHTS\\t25 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, The Town Without Water video, Floods Hit US. Small Towns along Mighty Mississippi video, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nSet the stage by making a connection to a local water story.? Tell students about a local situation related to a change in the amount of precipitation in your area. Here are some possible connections:\\n?\\tShare a picture of a local body of water that is or was unusually low. Say something like, I remember that this reservoir was really high in March, and now it is super low. I was thinking maybe we are getting less rain than usual or we are in a drought or something. It got me thinking about what else is out there, so I found some videos of other locations experiencing something like this, too.\\n?\\tIf you are in an area that has put in measures to address water shortages (e.g., no watering of lawns, etc.), say something like, We have been doing things to address the recent water shortages. It got me thinking about what it�s like in other places and what they are doing about things like water shortages. It also made me wonder about places where the opposite is happening.\\n?\\tIf you are in a place that has experienced floods or the bodies of water are unusually high, say something like, Who can remember the recent flood we had? It got me thinking�are we the only place experiencing this, and what are other people doing about floods? It also made me wonder about places where the opposite is happening.\\n?\\tIf you are in a place where neither droughts nor floods seem to be happening with enough frequency or seemingly little direct impact on the people living there, you could connect to other issues related to too much or too little water, such as earlier snowmelt or dry conditions that lead to wildfires.\\n\\nSet up for Notice and Wonder charts. Display slide A. Tell students that you have found 2 news stories that may relate to their own experiences with places that are getting too much or too little water. After preparing space in their notebook for this new unit, have students make a two-column chart on the next available page to record their noticings and wonderings from the videos. If students need support in recording noticings and wonderings from a video, you can show optional slide B and slide C, which offer suggestions for ideas they could include.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nStudents will find the anchoring phenomenon more compelling if it is presented in a meaningful context. Additionally, throughout Lessons 2-5, there are opportunities to weave your community�s story into the overall storyline. Therefore, adding a local story or local connection now will serve to increase relevance and interest for your students and will engage them in a deeper study of their community across the first lesson set.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting empathy and emotions: A unit on floods and droughts is likely to elicit emotional stress from some students, either in terms of the empathy they feel for those affected, or from experiencing the natural hazard directly or through the experiences of family and friends.\\n\\nEmotional stress from these events can often be great in students who feel they do not understand the situation or that they have no control over the situation. While droughts and floods often bring impacts that students cannot control, the aim of this unit is to help students understand what is\\n \\nhappening to cause these events and to feel as though they can understand them, and use their knowledge to understand a community�s response to them (e.g., water restrictions, flood warnings). If you have students who have traumatic experiences from a drought or flood event, a recommended source to read is located at the CDC Children in Disasters: Teachers and Childcare website at https://www.cdc.gov/childrenindisasters/sch ools.html .\\n\\n\\nShow the first clip. Play The Town Without Water video clip from https://youtu.be/cjGLcgy0qVs , which is also linked on slide D. This clip takes place in Porterville, CA. Have students record noticings and wonderings as the clip plays. Once the clip is over, give students an additional minute to record their noticings and wonderings on their charts.\\n\\nShare noticings and wonderings from the first clip. Show slide E. Take 3-4 minutes to have students share a few of the things they noticed and wondered about from the clip. There are two additional prompts on the slide to help guide students as they share noticings and wonderings. Start a public record of what they share, using chart paper, whiteboard, or digital document.\\n\\nShow the second clip. Say, I found another case that is having the opposite problem�too much water. Ask students to add a heading for Vicksburg, Mississippi, on the opposite page, and draw a second Notice and\\nWonder chart. Then play the Floods Hit US Small Towns along Mighty Mississippi video clip from https://youtu.be/X-iBXOHCEL0 , which is linked on slide F. As the clip plays, have students record noticings and wonderings. When the clip concludes, give students an additional minute to record their ideas.\\n\\nShare noticings and wonderings from the second clip. Show slide G. Take 3-4 minutes to have students share their noticings and wonderings with the class. There are two additional prompts on the slide to help guide students as they share noticings and wonderings. Start a public record of what they share, using chart paper, whiteboard, or digital document.\\n\\nReflect on how it might feel to live in one of these communities. Show slide H. Ask students to turn and talk about the questions on the slide: ?\\n?\\tHow might you feel if your town ran out of water? How would it change your daily life?\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� IDENTIFY PATTERNS IN HEADLINES ABOUT FLOODS AND DROUGHTS IN SMALL GROUPS\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: To promote student engagement you may choose to differentiate the degree of difficulty or complexity of the task by giving some groups both sets of headlines. Learners vary not only in their skills and abilities, but also in the kinds of challenges that motivate them to do their best work.\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� ASSIGN HOME LEARNING\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: This home learning is used to broaden students� thinking to related phenomena and leverage these everyday science experiences they have outside of school to augment the learning that happens in the classroom.\\nLocating the anchoring phenomena in the context of their community helps the phenomenon become more personally\\n \\nmeaningful to each student and supports student engagement. It also provides students an opportunity to talk about the phenomena with family members and other community members.\\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n4\\t� SHARE OUR WATER STORIES\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: large sticky notes\\n\\nNavigate back to the stories from day 1. Say, Yesterday we started with 2 communities that were facing challenges related to water. Let�s look back at our Notice and Wonder charts. What was the problem in each of those communities? Listen for the idea that Portersville was running out of water because of a drought, and Vicksburg was flooding worse than ever before.\\n\\nSet up a visual continuum to record our water stories. Write �Vicksburg, MS� and �Porterville, CA� on 2 big sticky notes (or on chart paper or in Jamboard) and place at either ends of a continuum drawn between the two places. Say, So, in one case, the\\ncommunity had too much water and, at the other end, not enough. Add those labels to the continuum.\\n\\nAsk students to share their water stories and add them to the continuum. Say, In addition to Porterville and Vicksburg, we analyzed headlines for other places experiencing similar things. Our own community may be experiencing problems, too. Let�s come up with some example headlines from our own stories and think about where they fit in relation to the other stories we�ve already seen. Show slide M. Ask a few students to share any stories they gathered about similar situations they or their families might have experienced. As students share, write a headline for what happened onto a sticky note and add it to the continuum (e.g., Hurricane Irene causes record flooding; Basements overflow as rivers rise; Families in Vietnam experience floods and droughts).\\n\\n\\n5\\t� DISCUSS PATTERNS IN HEADLINES ABOUT FLOODS AND DROUGHTS AS A CLASS\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPatterns in drought-related headlines\\tPatterns in flood-related headlines\\n?\\tLess precipitation: e.g. less rain/snow/dry; less winter snow; droughts, dry\\n?\\tNew normal: e.g. normal changing; weird weather is new normal; record-breaking\\n?\\tRecord-breaking heat: e.g. during drought; hot and dry; heat wave; hot\\n?\\tDry and fires\\t?\\tMore precipitation: e.g. historic flooding; major flooding; worsening floods; more rain, floods, snow; wettest on record\\n?\\t�new normal�: e.g. more often; happening more\\n?\\tRising temps\\n?\\tMore in spring\\nSimilarities:\\n?\\t�New normal�; historic, record-breaking\\n?\\tHeat, heat wave, rising temperatures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\t� IDENTIFY WHAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE IN OUR MODELS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL AND COMPARE WITH A PARTNER\\t15 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook\\n\\n \\nIndividually develop an initial model. Project slide S. Give students about 8 minutes to develop an initial model to answer the questions, �How can increased temperatures lead to both droughts AND floods?� and �What is causing the temperatures to increase?�\\nKeep the slide with the questions and image for the model visible, as well as the list of things to include in their models.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nWhile students work on their models to connect temperature changes to droughts and floods, use prompts such as the following to help students think about both cause and effect and stability and change:\\n?\\tHow did your partner explain how a small change in temperature leads to large changes in other parts of the system?\\n?\\tWhat cause did your partner identify that led to an effect of temperature going up?\\n?\\tDid they explain how or why that caused an increase in temperature?\\n \\n \\n\\n8\\t� BEGIN TO DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL\\t10 min\\n\\n \\nGather students in a Scientists Circle to develop an initial consensus model. Have students bring their science notebooks with them to the circle. Take this opportunity to remind the class how we listen to one another, press upon one another�s ideas, and ask questions of one another; and it�s OK to disagree with ideas, but it�s important to be respectful. Remind students of the agreed-upon classroom norms.\\n\\n\\nAs a class, work together to build a consensus model.? Project slide U to remind your students of the purpose of this initial consensus model discussion. Remind students that the model is a chance to decide what the class agrees upon with the explanation for the phenomenon/problem and where the class is less certain and has questions. Before starting the discussion, project slide V to remind students of the 2 questions our model is trying to explain.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: You may use color coding to foreground parts of the model. Although color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding helps ensure accessibility for any student who may be color-blind. Create a key to track what colors, symbols, numbers, or letters represent different parts of the system. Keep this in mind as students begin to develop their Earth�s Water System Model in L2 and later when students develop their Carbon System Model in lesson set 2.\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLead a discussion about how an increase in temperatures causes an increase in both floods and droughts. As students share their ideas, listen to what they believe is important to represent on the consensus model. During this modeling moment, it is important to honor students� ideas and create a model that reflects their thinking versus making an exact copy of the model shown here. An example of this first part of the initial consensus model can be found below. This is just one example of the model, and it could potentially have different areas of agreement and disagreement. It�s important to follow your students� ideas during this discussion and not feel strongly tied to replicating this exact model.\\n\\nExample Initial Consensus Model for temperature\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompts\\n \\nSample student responses\\n \\nFollow-up questions\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat are some ideas you and your partner agreed on for how increased temperatures might be leading to more droughts?\\n \\nWe both said there isn�t a lot of water because the ground is dry.\\n \\nIs this something others showed?\\n\\nWhat might be causing this? Are there other sources of water besides the ground?\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n \\n9\\t� CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AN INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: None\\n\\nGather in a Scientists Circle to continue the initial consensus model. As students enter the classroom, have them bring their notebooks to the Scientists Circle.\\nDisplay slide V and the first part of the model that the class worked on during the previous class period. Ask a student to remind the class of the questions we are trying to answer with our model.\\n\\nTurn and talk about temperature changes. Give students 2 minutes to turn and talk with a partner about the ideas that they generated to answer the question: What is causing the temperatures to increase? If students are having trouble explaining what is causing the temperatures to increase, direct them to look back at their individual models and consider what their partners had shared with them while looking for similarities and differences.\\n\\nDiscuss similarities and differences in ideas. After students have had a chance to share their ideas with a partner, lead a discussion regarding the mechanism that might be causing an increase in temperatures. Capture ideas on the initial class\\nconsensus model as they are shared by the class, paying special attention to areas of agreement and disagreement.\\n\\nAdditional examples of an initial consensus model can be found below. These are only examples of the model, and it�s important to follow your students� ideas during this discussion and not feel strongly tied to replicating this exact model.\\n \\n\\n \\t \\n\\nIf students mention a widely used word, such as global warming, probe students to explain what the word means and how or why global warming could cause a temperature increase. Example prompts and responses are below.\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompts\\n \\nSample student responses\\n \\nFollow-up questions\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat are some ideas you and your partner agreed on for what might be causing increased temperatures?\\n \\nWe both said global warming.\\n \\nCan you say more about what you mean when you say global warming?\\n\\nDid others include this? How did you describe what global warming is and how it explains increased temperatures?\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat other ideas did you have for what might cause an increase in temperatures?\\n \\nI said pollution, and my partner said greenhouse gases.\\n \\nSo, are you saying that pollution and greenhouse gases are the same thing?\\n\\nDid anyone else talk about this in their model?\\n \\n \\n\\n10\\t� INDIVIDUALLY GENERATE QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\nPrepare for the Driving Question Board. Display slide W. Remind students that we are going to try to capture all of our questions about what could be causing an increase in floods and droughts and an increase in temperatures. Explain to students that we can use our questions to guide our investigation into what is going on. To do this, we are going to build a Driving Question Board (DQB).?\\n\\nPrompt students to take out and review the following resources (in their science notebooks):\\n?\\tnoticings and wonderings from stories and headlines\\n?\\tyour initial model\\n?\\tthe initial class model\\n\\nDiscuss types of questions that can help us get to an explanation for our phenomena. Say, We are really curious about what is causing temperature changes, how temperature changes cause floods and droughts, and how even air temperature could be related to water cycling processes. Let\\'s think about how we can ask our questions to help us get to these explanations. What kinds of questions could help us get at the causes of all this stuff? What kinds of questions could help us answer how all of the things�even things that don\\'t seem related�could be connected?\\n\\nPost question stems like the ones below to support students in asking causal questions or systems-related questions.\\n?\\tHow does \\tcause   to happen?\\n?\\tIf we do \\t, will \\thappen?\\n?\\tHow is this \\tin the system related to \\t?\\n?\\tWhat is happening with \\tto cause \\t?\\n\\nUsing their resources, ask students to generate a list of questions that they have about what could cause increased temperatures and their link to droughts, floods, and other related phenomena.? Students should record their questions on sticky notes�one question\\nper sticky note. They should write their questions so that they are big and bold and so that everyone can see the questions clearly.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA DQB provides a public representation of the class�s joint mission. Students can share their questions and wonderings with one another, and the visual representation offers another modality for students to access science in the classroom. The DQB should be centrally located in the classroom so that it can be referenced and added to throughout the unit.\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilingual Students: Asking questions in everyday language allows students to share their thinking or experiences, even if they do not have the appropriate scientific vocabulary yet. This is helpful for emergent multilingual students because by not requiring scientific words at the onset, you do not limit their participation in classroom discourse.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.C Ask questions that arise from initial observations of stories and headlines about rising temperatures, floods, and droughts to clarify whether increasing temperatures are related to or causing both floods and droughts.\\n\\nWhat to look for: Look for questions that are open (how/why) versus closed (yes/no), and also testable questions in the classroom. Also listen for questions that address both parts of our model.\\n \\n \\n\\n11\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nFirst and foremost during the formation of the DQB is reinforcing a classroom community wherein all ideas are valued and everyone has a question up on the board. Use your judgement on how to press students to form �how� and �why� questions. If a student struggles with sharing, encourage them to go public with questions rather than focusing specifically on forming a �how� or �why� question.\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR DATA AND INFORMATION WE NEED\\t10 min\\n\\n \\nBrainstorm ideas for data and information we need. Project slide Y. Now that the class has created a DQB, tell students that it is time to really dig into the hard work of figuring out what is going on! Ask students, What kinds of information or data do we need to figure out the answers to our questions?\\n\\nPrompt students to use the categories of questions from the DQB to identify the data and information that would help them answer the category of question. Refer to the initial classroom consensus model. Encourage students to also look at the areas where we have questions noted by question marks and think about what we could do to help us better understand these parts of our consensus model.\\n\\nHave students turn and talk about their ideas before sharing out with the whole group. Assign each small group a category of questions to focus on. Have small groups share out their ideas with the whole group. Make sure that all groups get to share at least a few ideas. Make a class record of the ideas for future investigations and data we need. You may want to prompt students to keep a record of our proposed investigations in their science notebooks. Some examples are provided below:\\n\\nCategory of questions\\tData and information that we need\\nWhat do pollution/greenhouse gases have to do with this?\\tTrap air in bottles/jars to see what changes it with certain gases? Make little greenhouses using plastic bags?\\nUse a simulation.\\nWhat�s happening with floods and droughts?\\tLook at other locations besides 2 videos�data and other videos?\\nWhat is happening with temperatures/global warming?\\tLook at temperature data over a really long period of time.\\n\\nSay, It seems like we have identified areas that we think are changing. But what is changing? What is normal? How could we figure out what is normal for Porterville and Vicksburg, and whether it is just in these places, or happening elsewhere? Tell students we�ll pick up from there in the next class.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RST.6-8.1: Cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of science and technical texts.\\nOn days 1 and 2, students analyze text in the form of headlines to find patterns in what is happening with floods and droughts in different locations and what might be causing them.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What happens when two things hit each other?\\n\\n \\n\\nPrevious Lesson  There is no previous lesson.\\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n3 days\\n \\n\\n\\nWe share our experiences with cell phones breaking and demonstrate some ways they have broken.

We develop a model to describe visible changes happening to the objects in a collision and nonvisible interactions occurring as well. We develop questions for our Driving Question Board (DQB) and possible investigations we could do to answer these questions.\\n \\n\\n\\nNext Lesson We will explore colliding objects and record observations about changes in their motion and shape.

This can be made from index cards, construction paper, or sticky notes.\\n \\n \\t \\t \\t \\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson is meant to draw out students� prior experiences with collisions and to help them consider what might determine whether something breaks in a collision. This is an opportunity to pre-assess students� engagement in all three dimensions of NGSS to explain a phenomenon. There are prompts in the initial modeling task that ask students to engage in two elements of the modeling practice related to representing descriptive aspects of the phenomena as well as unobservable mechanisms. Students are prompted to explain the mechanisms that caused the observable changes, which will provide an opportunity to bring related DCIs from prior grades: grade 4 (energy transfer in collisions), grade 2 (objects pull or push each other when they collide), and the middle school grade band explanation (such as equal force pairs between the two objects in contact). There are phrases in the prompts that ask students to consider related elements of CCCs as well, particularly cause and effect, systems and system models, and stability and change.\\n\\nYou may also see some students developing particle-level representations for changes happening to the matter in the system in their initial models, based on their extensive work in developing such models in prior OpenSciEd units: OpenSciEd Unit 6.2: How can containers keep stuff from warming up or cooling down? (Cup Design Unit), OpenSciEd Unit 6.3: Why does a lot of hail, rain, or snow fall at some times and not others? (Storms Unit), OpenSciEd Unit 7.1: How can we make something new that was not there before? (Bath Bombs Unit), OpenSciEd Unit 7.2: How can we use chemical reactions to design a solution to a problem? (Homemade Heater Unit), OpenSciEd Unit 7.3: How do things inside our bodies work together to make us feel the way we do? (Inside Our Bodies Unit), and OpenSciEd Unit 7.4: Where does food come from, and where does it go next? (Maple Syrup Unit).\\n\\nStudents may be curious about which materials are fragile and why or how to protect things that break easily. Students may also be curious about how the motion or mass or size of the objects before the collision affects the outcome. This curiosity will seed future investigations.\\n\\nStudents are likely to identify many of the factors or variables that influence whether an object does or does not get damaged in a collision, such as mass, speed, area of contact, and material type or thickness. The factors and variables identified will motivate many of the subsequent lesson questions and investigations in the first half of the unit.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nIf students do not talk about physics concepts like force, energy, or motion in this first lesson, do not introduce them yet. These words will be explicitly introduced in the next lesson. This lesson, while focusing on contact forces, will not yet ask students to understand or utilize the ideas of positional energy, differences in materials, or elastic limits. These ideas will be developed in future lessons. Students may have a partial understanding of energy transfer from Cup Design Unit, Tsunami Unit, Storms Unit, Bath Bombs Unit, and Homemade Heater Unit. While students may represent in their models that this energy transfer is occurring, later lessons will help students understand the relationships among mass, speed, and damage due to the transfer of energy across a medium.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� SET THE STAGE FOR A NEW PHENOMENON\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: 3 blank pieces of chart paper, small stack of blank 8.5� � 11� paper, 2 different color markers, 4 CD cases, 5 sets of goggles, Different Collisions poster\\n\\n \\nIntroduce cell phone damage information. Display slide A. Say, I came across some interesting data about cell phone damages. Listen to the things I learned! Read each statistic aloud.\\n?\\tAmericans break 2 smartphone screens every second.\\n?\\tMore than 50 million phone screens are cracked each year.\\n?\\tAn estimated 95 million phones were damaged in the world by dropping them.\\n?\\tWe spend $3.4 BILLION each year in replacing cracked screens--not counting the 38% of smartphone owners who don�t replace them at all.\\n?\\t27% of people said that their phone was in a case when they broke it.\\n\\nSay, This seems like a lot of cell phone damage happening in our world. That got me wondering how common this sort of phenomenon is in our classroom community. Have any of you ever experienced cell phone damage before?\\n\\nInstruct students to raise their hands if they have experienced a situation where they have seen a phone get damaged.\\n\\nElicit student experiences. Display slide B. Ask students to turn and talk with a partner about the slide question: �Have you or someone you know ever broken a phone? What caused it to break? Describe your experiences.�\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSay, Wow, we seem to have a lot of experience with damaging cell phones! It sounds like some of you have been the ones to create the damage, and some of you have seen them damaged before.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nEmergent Multilingual Learners: For students who are learning English or who need support following a whole-group discussion, it can be helpful to use gestures in addition to talking. For example, as you describe a phone hitting a wall, demonstrate the collision by holding a phone (or another object to represent a phone) in your hand and moving it slowly toward the wall.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nEmergent Multilingual Learners: A Word Wall will become a useful space for recording a shared meaning of new words as students develop a deeper meaning for them. When developing new vocabulary, some strategies that may benefit emergent language learners are to use student-friendly definitions, make connections to cognate words when possible, and include a visual representation of the word. You have now developed a visual representation of the word collision that you can refer to over the course of this unit. After students have had time to develop a conceptual model or understanding for these words, they will no longer need the visual representation.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIntroduce a CD case to represent a phone in collisions. Display slide C. Say, I would love to hear about your experiences with phones breaking, but sometimes it\\'s easier for us to understand a situation where something occurred when we can see a representation of how it happened rather than just hearing about it. Phones are expensive, so I have a CD case here that we are going to use as a substitute for a phone. I thought we could use this as a manipulative to represent what happened to the phone when it got damaged.\\n\\nDemonstrate phone breaking experiences. Select one volunteer at a time to come up in front of the class and demonstrate what happened with the cell phone when it broke. Let students know it\\'s OK if what they show us ends up causing the CD case to break too, as we want to try to understand the interactions that happened and the results as accurately as possible. Remind them to be responsible and avoid moving the CD case or any other object in a direction that might remotely come in contact with another living thing or fragile object.\\n\\n \\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\\n \\nReview any safety guidelines and have students wear goggles who are demonstrating the collision and standing or sitting near the demonstration during this and all future investigations in this unit. Setting up strong boundaries and expectations with the demonstrations is key. Students will show a variety of collisions with cell phones during this stage. Some possible scenarios to expect are dropping the CD case on different objects, slamming objects onto the CD case, ramming objects into the CD case (e.g., foot, backpack, chair), and flinging the CD case at a wall. Ask demonstration volunteers if the interaction they are about to enact is safe to show with others around and if it can be safely done in the classroom may help ensure safety as students are demonstrating their experiences.\\n \\n\\nUse the prompts below to elicit experiences from student volunteers so that you get at least one example that would represent each of the three collision types: A, B, and C.\\n\\nAs each student shares their experience, create a diagram on a blank piece of paper using squares to represent the two objects that collided. After creating each diagram, attach it on the Different Collisions poster. Draw large enough for students to see. The diagrams will become part of an anchor chart for students to refer to later. The three diagrams (A, B, C; that you will finish drawing in the subsequent conversation) should be similar to ones shown here. As you are drawing, remember to represent the phone as a white box and the other object as a shaded box instead of the actual objects being described by students. This will help students later to transfer and categorize the general diagrammatic representations into related phenomena experiences.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompts\\n \\nSample student responses\\n \\nFollow-up questions\\n \\n\\n \\nMost of the interesting figures from the article were about phones getting damaged by dropping them or accidentally throwing them. Does anyone have any examples they can show us where the phone was moving and it ended up hitting something that was not moving?\\n \\nI dropped my phone down a flight of stairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe phone was moving.\\n\\n\\nNothing else was moving. It just hit the stairs.\\n \\nOh wow! That is not good. I\\'ll try to draw what happened as you show us how it happened. What was moving?\\n\\nSo the stairs were motionless?\\n\\n\\nSo it sounds like we have a fragile object moving toward and hitting something motionless. Cool. Let�s label this collision type �A�.\\n \\n\\n(Draw representation A for this scenario.)\\n\\n \\nAre there any examples where things were moving and then damaged the phone? Is the phone always the thing that is moving when it gets damaged, or can it be motionless and get hit by something else moving?\\n \\nSomething else can be moving and hit it to make it break, like when I accidentally dropped my book bag on top of my phone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bag was moving.\\n\\n\\nThe phone was not moving.\\n \\nWow that�s interesting! Show us what happened. Let me draw this out so we can all see what happened as you show us. What was moving?\\n\\n\\n\\nWas the phone not moving?\\n\\n\\nSo the moving book bag hit the nonmoving, fragile phone, correct? Awesome. Let�s call this type B.\\n\\n(Draw representation B for this scenario.)\\n \\n\\n \\nAre there any other instances where things were moving to damage the phone? Does every phone-breaking story have one thing that wasn�t moving, or can both things move and run into each other to cause damage?\\n \\nTwo things can definitely run into each other to cause damage!\\n\\n\\n\\n(Some students will likely raise their hand.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI saw a video of someone throwing a phone like a baseball and it getting hit with a baseball bat. It did not turn out well for the phone.\\n\\n\\nBoth objects were--the bat and the phone.\\n \\n(Poll students.) Has anyone ever had this happen to them or seen this happen? Raise your hand if this has happened to you or someone you know.\\n\\nDoes anyone have an example they would like to share where both the phone and something else were moving and hit each other to cause damage?\\n\\nThat sounds like it really got damaged! Show us what happened. Let me draw this one too. What was moving?\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nYes.\\n \\nSo everything was moving?\\n\\n\\nOK. Let�s write type �C� on this piece of paper.\\n\\n(Draw representation C for this scenario.)\\n \\n\\n\\nDiscuss and alter frames of reference. Revisit the drawings and place the Different Collisions poster in a spot that is easily viewable for students, if not already in a prominent spot in the classroom. First, remove the piece of paper with collision type A that shows the diagram that has a moving, fragile object colliding with a motionless object (collisions type A). Use the prompts below to help students consider changes to the frame of reference.\\n\\n\\nReturn collision type A back to the Different Collisions poster. If needed, remove the collision types B and C from the Different Collisions poster and repeat this line of questioning with collision types B and C.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCategorize remaining interactions. Ask students if they have any other stories that would be represented differently than our drawings. If a student says yes, have them demonstrate the interaction while you map it out on a blank piece of paper. Compare the interaction to the other collision types on the chart, turning it to see if the interaction matches any existing collision type scenarios. Help students draw the conclusion that the scenario is already on the collision types board by simply changing the frame of reference.\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduce the word collision to students.?\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� BRAINSTORMING RELATED PHENOMENA\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, 2-3 red cards per student, 2-3 green cards per student, Different Collisions poster, Related Phenomena poster\\n\\nDocument related phenomena on index cards. Project slide D. Read through the directions on the slide. Pass out 2-3 red and green index cards to each student. If red and green cards are not being used, update slide D and slide E to reflect the colors of the index cards or sticky note being used.\\n\\nPrompt students to record at least one collision where something has been damaged on red cards and at least one collision where something was surprisingly not damaged on green cards. For each thing listed, students should identify the objects that came into contact with each other during the collision and underline the object or objects that were moving before the collision occurred. Only one collision example should be written on each card.\\n\\nProvide students approximately 5 minutes to generate and record their related phenomena cards. Encourage students to use as many cards as they need as they think of other examples.\\n\\nHang the Different Collisions poster to the left of the Related Phenomena poster. Then, circulate during the remaining time to help any student who may become stuck while trying to brainstorm examples.\\n\\nWith about a minute left, remind students to go back over their cards and make sure that they have identified the objects that came into contact with each other during the collision and have underlined which objects were moving before the collision occurred.\\n \\n3\\t� SHARE AND COMPARE RELATED PHENOMENA\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, related phenomena index cards, Related Phenomena poster, 3 areas of the room labeled �A� �B� and �C�\\n\\n \\nRevisit the different collision types. Display slide E. Read through slide E and go over each type of collision, emphasizing what objects were moving or not moving before the collision. A quick reference table is given below.\\n\\nCollision type\\tMotion of the objects before the collision and the resulting damage\\nA\\tA moving object was damaged OR wasn�t damaged when it collided with a motionless object.\\nB\\tA motionless object was damaged OR wasn�t damaged when a moving object collided with it.\\nC\\tA moving object was damaged OR wasn�t damaged when it collided with another moving object.\\n\\nSay, In class we have identified three different types of collisions. Let�s sort our related collisions into these categories and see if we notice any patterns or factors that may contribute to damage in the collisions. Look at your index cards and write the collision type at the top of each one--A. B. or C.\\n\\nHave students ask an elbow partner to quickly check their collision types. If there is debate on the collision type, help students sort out the appropriate type individually.\\n\\nShare related phenomena. Display slide F. Students will organize themselves based upon related phenomena and share their phenomena with a partner.? During this time students will be developing the idea of different factors or variables that impact damage.\\n\\nSay, In a moment, you will get the chance to share your related phenomena with someone else. There are 3 sections of the room labeled A, B, and C. When I ask you to, you will look at the collision type on one of your cards and go to the area with that collision type. Once you are there, find someone and share your collision. As you share, be thinking about what is similar and different between the two collisions.\\n\\nAsk students to look at one of their red, damage cards first. Direct them to move to the area of the room that matches their collision type. Give students 2 minutes to share and compare and contrast with their partners. After the two minutes are up, ask students to look at one of their green, no-damage cards. Direct students to move to the area that matches their green card collision type. Give students 2 minutes to share and compare and contrast with their partners.\\n\\nTell students to hand in all of their index cards and return to their seats.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: It is important to organize activities in ways that create opportunities to support student engagement in meaningful, accountable talk by emphasizing socially safe activity structures (e.g., small-group or partner work before a whole-class discussion). This is especially beneficial to emergent multilingual students. For this reason, partner talk or small-group talk should precede whole-group sharing to give students an opportunity to share their ideas with one or two peers before going public with the whole class.\\n \\n\\n4\\t� SET UP NOTEBOOKS AND STOP AND JOT COLLISION FACTORS\\t6 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Different Collisions poster, Related Phenomena poster, tape\\n\\n \\nPrepare science notebooks. Say, It seems like we were finding a lot of similarities, differences, and maybe even some important factors and variables across our collisions. Let�s make sure to record these ideas!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentifying factors in a collision. Project slide G. Ask students to begin a new page in their science notebook to set up the related T-chart.? Give students 4 minutes to record any patterns they saw in the collisions they discussed.? Have students focus on looking for clues about possible factors or variables that would cause something to get damaged or not get damaged during a collision and record them on their charts. Some potential ideas for factors or variables include the following:\\n?\\tmass of the object\\n?\\tspeed of the object\\n?\\tdirection of the object\\n?\\tif the object was moving or not\\n?\\tangle at which the object was struck\\n?\\tmaterial the object is made from\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Keeping a science notebook allows students a space in which to reflect and communicate their developing understandings about science ideas and to track changes in their understandings. Students should be encouraged to record their ideas using linguistic (e.g., written words) and nonlinguistic (e.g.,taping in photographs, creating drawings, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, and measurements) modes.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilinguals: This is especially important for emerging multilingual students because making connections between written words and nonlinguistic representations helps students generate richer explanations of scientific phenomena.\\n \\n \\n\\n5\\t� CREATE INITIAL MODELS\\t12 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: Initial Model: Objects During Collisions, Object Interactions During A Collision, science notebook\\n\\n \\nDevelop initial models of objects during a collision. Say, Let�s try to develop a model to explain what is happening when two things come into contact in a collision. Display slide H.?\\n\\nDistribute a copy of Initial Model: Objects During Collisions to each student. Tell students that they should put their name on their handout but don�t add it to their notebooks yet, as you want to\\ncollect it at the end of the period to get a sense of what they are thinking. Ask students to look at the Related Phenomena poster where they listed examples of things that have been damaged or surprisingly not been damaged in collisions. Ask students to pick one of these examples to explain on their handout.\\n\\nSay, You are going to use this handout to develop a model to show what interactions are happening between the objects during a collision. On the first line, list the two objects that collided. Did you choose an example that matched collision type A, B, or C? List which scenario you chose. Look at the next question: Was there damage in this collision? Write �yes� if there was damage and �no� if there was not damage. Give students a minute to answer the first three questions on their handout before moving on to the boxes below.\\n\\nSay, In the space below, imagine you could slow time down and could also freeze or pause the collision at different points in time. What do you think you would see happening to the materials right at the moment the objects first touched or made contact with each other in the collision? That�s this box on the left labeled �Time point 1�. How about a split second later? That�s the box on the right labeled �Time point 2�. Draw and label or describe in words what you think you would see happening for both objects at each time point.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter 3-4 minutes, distribute Object Interactions During A Collision. Project slide I. Say, Look at the questions on this second handout and look at the model you just drew. The first question is asking you to think about what is happening with the objects between time point 1 and time point 2.\\nWhat changes do you think you could see happening between those two points in time?\\n\\nThe second question asks you to think about the interactions that you cannot see happening with the objects in a collision. What interactions between those two points in time do you think you couldn�t see happening with those objects as they collided?\\n\\nThe third question wants you to think about what changes to these interactions might lead to more or less damage. When we are talking about their interactions, we are talking about the ways that they are acting on and affecting each other when they are touching. What changes to the way that they are acting on and affecting each other when they are touching would lead to more or less damage?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\n1.\\tThe word model means something specific in this context that it might not mean for students in other contexts. Remind students that in this classroom, a model is a picture and/or description that helps us explain something that happens in the world. We are asking students to make a model to help explain why something gets damaged when it is involved in a collision. Like their work in previous OpenSciEd units, such models should be trying to do more than just show what we can see, they should also try to represent any unobservable mechanisms that we think might be at work in the system.\\n\\n2.\\tStudents take into account multiple factors that may contribute to damage in a collision. While it will be relatively intuitive for some students to attend to the ideas of variables changing in the system, some changes that are unobservable at the micro level must also be occurring. This focus on unobservable mechanisms is where students will likely need additional encouragement to make their thinking visible on paper. Such prompting is more likely to raise awareness that there is a gap in the current explanatory model (if the student can�t think of any candidate mechanisms), or it may also help them connect to previous ideas about forces or energy they may have developed though prior instruction.\\n \\nGive students the remaining time to consider the questions and respond.?? At the end of the class period, have students hand in Initial Model: Objects During Collisions and Object Interactions During A Collision for a formative assessment. If students have constructed the initial models in their notebooks, have students hand in their notebooks.\\n \\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING STABILITY AND CHANGE\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.A Develop a model to describe interactions between two objects as they collide and show the changes that occur in the structure of both objects when one object is damaged as a result and also when neither object is damaged as a result.\\n\\nWhat to look for/listen for\\n?\\tUnobservable mechanisms: Prompts in this task ask students to engage in two elements of the modeling practice related to representing descriptive aspects of the phenomena as well as unobservable mechanisms (energy transfer in collisions and objects pushing on each other when they collide). You may also see some students using particle-level representations to help explain changes occurring in the objects in the collison, based on their extensive work in developing such models in prior OpenSciEd units.\\n?\\tFactors or variables that cause the materials to break or not break in a collision, such as mass, speed, area of contact, material type and thickness, any other structural differences students wish to identify\\n?\\tOther connections to CCCs: There are phrases in the prompts that ask students to consider connections to related elements of CCCs, particularly cause and effect, systems and system models, and stability and change. These may lead students to develop and use ideas that help them connect ideas about forces, energy, and changes occurring in the object. These ideas will be developed later in this unit. Here is a good opportunity to see if students are already making some of these connections:\\n?\\tIn a collision objects exert forces on each other; those forces cause energy to be transferred (effect) to or from the objects.\\n?\\tEach object in the collision (subsystem) exerts a force on the other object in the collision; these forces are equal in strength and opposite in direction.\\n?\\tThese forces (cause) also result in some deformation (change or effect) of each object.\\n?\\tAn object�s structure (the type of materials it is made of and the shapes of those materials) affects how much it will deform and how much it will push back in a collision before breaking.\\n?\\tDeformation beyond a certain point results in damage (a permanent shape change); but deformation below that point does not (stability).\\n?\\tThe amount of kinetic energy objects have in a system is related to the amount of energy that can be transferred between them and the amount of peak force they will apply to each other in a collision; the amount of kinetic energy is related to the mass and speed of the object.\\n \\n\\nModeling and explaining visible changes provides students the opportunity to show understanding of Stability and Change.\\nGrades 3-5 experiences should have accentuated that although some systems appear stable, they can change over time. By asking questions that allow students to dwell on the moment of impact and what happens shortly after the collision, prior conceptions about instantaneous damage can be uncovered. Students may believe that shape changes do not happen unless there is damage, or damage is only limited to the breaking of objects. At this point students are not expected to exhibit understanding of these ideas nor do they need to show changes at different scales (including the particle level) that occur over the duration of the collision. Over the course of the unit, students will develop an understanding of shape change that occurs during collisions, force pairs, and the interactions of objects in a collision.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nThis is an opportunity to pre-assess students� engagement in all three dimensions of NGSS to explain a phenomenon. There are prompts in this task that ask students to engage in two elements of the modeling\\n \\npractice related to representing descriptive aspects of the phenomena as well as unobservable mechanisms. Students are prompted to explain the mechanisms that caused the observable changes, which will provide an opportunity to bring related DCIs from prior grades: grade 4 (energy transfer in collisions), grade 2 (objects pull or push each other when they collide), and the middle school grade band explanation (such as equal force pairs between the two objects in contact). There are phrases in the prompts that ask students to consider related elements of CCCs as well, particularly cause and effect, systems and system models, and stability and change.\\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n6\\t� ESTABLISH SCIENTISTS CIRCLE AND SHARE INITIAL MODELS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: Initial Model: Objects During Collisions, Object Interactions During A Collision, science notebook, tape\\n\\n \\nReturn materials to students. Return Initial Model: Objects During Collisions and Object Interactions During A Collision to science notebooks to students. If students used the loose handouts instead of recording in their science notebooks, give students time to attach the handouts to a notebook page using tape.\\n\\nForm a Scientists Circle for the first time. Ask students to assemble their chairs in a circle and to bring their science notebooks and something to write with. Students will remain in the circle for all of class, though they will move among partner, small-group, and\\nwhole-class discussions. This will help minimize the movement of chairs throughout the class period. As students get more comfortable with the Scientists Circle, they can move between it and other activity structures more quickly. Ideally, they will need to be able to see the slides and have access to a whiteboard, but if that is not possible, use only the whiteboard (or chart paper), which is where the more critical sensemaking will occur for the rest of the class.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting Emergent Multilinguals: Before students engage in whole-class discussions, it can be helpful to first provide them with the opportunity to work with others--either in pairs, triads, or small groups--on ideas related to their reasoning. These smaller group structures can be especially helpful for emerging multilingual students because they offer students a chance to engage in sensemaking with their peers and also the space to use their linguistic and nonlinguistic resources to express their ideas (and learn from other students� uses of these resources too).\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare initial models with a partner.? Display slide J. Ask students to keep track of similarities and differences between (1) what they think would happen at each point in time for each model and (2) the factors and variables that may have contributed to damage or no damage.\\n\\n7\\t� ESTABLISH SHARED NORMS\\t10 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: It is important to use this norm-building time to begin to cultivate an equitable learning\\n \\nIntroduce science classroom norms. Tell students that before the class moves on with further investigations, it is time to set up some norms for how the class wants to work and learn together. You may want to reiterate productive behaviors you witnessed in the first day of Lesson 1 as a way of communicating to students that they were already operating using some positive norms, but they had not yet talked about them.\\n\\nDisplay slide K and pass out the handout Science Classroom Norms. Note: Edit the handout and slide as desired for your classroom.\\n\\nRemind students that in prior units we have used norms to help develop a productive and respectful learning environment. They are similar to rules but are intended to ensure that all students have a positive learning experience in science class.\\n\\nThe norms on the handout and the slide are a starting point for the class.? It is important to talk through each one with students and ask them to provide an example or paraphrase the norm. The purpose of this is to develop a shared understanding of each norm. Also, provide opportunities for students to clarify a norm, ask for a modification, or develop a new norm. Allow students to write on their handouts if the class decides to change something. Norms are intended to be shared by the students and teacher, so even though a set has been provided, it is just a starting point.\\n\\nChoose a norm to work on today. Ask students to read through the norms one more time, nominate one norm that may be particularly hard to follow, and suggest a strategy that could help everyone adhere to it. Then, before the students end their conversation, ask them to silently pick one norm from the sheet that they personally will work on today. Give them at least 30 seconds of quiet, individual think-time to make this decision.\\n \\ncommunity that promotes trusting and caring relationships that foster student engagement. The norms should remind students to value the diversity of classroom community members and equity in the sensemaking work they will do together this school year. It is critical that the norms support safe and fair participation and interrupt cultural norms or stereotypes that could make science experiences feel uncomfortable to students (e.g., being someone who is not intelligent enough to think like a scientist, who cannot do the relevant math, who cannot share their thinking).\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n8\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL CONSENSUS MODEL DISCUSSION AND RELATED QUESTIONS\\t25 min\\n\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nAccept all reasonable student ideas in this discussion. Revoice students� ideas and use questions, such as I heard you say\\t, is that right? or Are you saying \\t? to clarify student thinking. However, do not challenge students beyond their contributions at this point.\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nShift to the column labeled �Changes we can see� and �Interactions we cannot see�. Start with the students� responses for the changes we can see. Then move to the interactions we cannot see. Use two different colored markers to represent the two different categories of responses. Refer students to Object Interactions During A Collision for ideas on what we can all agree upon and areas of disagreement. Have students share out what changes we can see occurring between the two objects. Begin with the collision with the damage box and record student ideas. If students can agree across the class on a change we can see, put an exclamation point or other symbol to indicate that there is a whole-class agreement on this idea. If students do not agree on an idea or it does not represent every student�s thinking, add a question mark beside the idea. If students have an idea as something that can be seen as well as cannot be seen, star the idea with the marker use to represent the other category (can be seen vs. cannot be seen) to represent that this idea falls into the two different categories (visible and nonvisible) and will be revisited in later lessons. An example of this can be seen in the chart below. On this chart, fracturing was listed first as an interaction we cannot see AND a change that we can see. A pink star was added next to it to indicate that it falls into both categories.\\n\\n\\nAfter potential agreements and disagreements have been identified and recorded, move to the remaining empty box that represents a collision without damage.\\n \\n \\n\\n9\\t� DETERMINE FACTORS AND VARIABLES THAT AFFECT DAMAGE\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n10\\t� NAVIGATION\\t3 min\\n\\n\\n11\\t� REVISIT FACTORS AND VARIABLES POSTER\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n12\\t� DRIVING QUESTION BOARD AND IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t28 min\\n\\n\\n\\n?

This could be an in-class or home learning assignment. For practice (e.g., exit or entrance ticket) the following two questions can be answered at the end or start of any future lessons:\\n?\\tWhat questions were raised for us (now or from the end of the last class)?\\n?\\tHow might we investigate one or more of those questions using equipment in our classroom to collect our own data or using data that other people have collected in other places?\\n?\\tIf students are not asking about the factors and variables that may contribute to damage, have students refer to the Patterns in collisions chart they created in their notebooks and think about how changing\\n \\nand has no new ones, have the student place one of their questions on top of the question that is similar so other students can visually see how many of the questions are the same or related.

We observe a window in a building moving, and it seems to be caused by sound blasting from a truck in the parking lot. We agree that a speaker inside the truck is making these sounds. We observe a speaker up close to see what it�s doing when it makes sound. We use the observations from these phenomena to think about other\\nsound-related phenomena, which in turn leads us to form a broader set of questions on our Driving Question Board (DQB). Then we brainstorm ways for the class to investigate these questions.\\n \\n\\n\\nNext Lesson We will observe various musical instruments and a speaker when they are making sounds and connect what we discover to what we observe when we analyze slow-motion videos of similar objects.

You should see the outside ring of the volume knob light up. Start music playing from the music source, and then turn up the volume dial to confirm you can hear it. Students can adjust the volume further (up to your discretion; it can get very loud) and adjust the treble/bass knobs as desired during their investigations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10.\\tUse plastic wrap to create a model of the window.

Use caution if students are adjusting the volume.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson elicits students� initial ideas about how sounds can cause things far away to move. In this lesson students are introduced to the anchoring phenomenon--a video of a truck playing music causes a window nearby to vibrate. This leads students to start wondering about other sound-related phenomena, which in turn leads to a wealth of new questions, such as, (1) What causes different sounds? (2) What is traveling from a sound source to our ears? (3) How are sounds received? By the end of the unit students will be able to answer these questions in terms of how patterns of differences in vibrations are tied to differences in characteristics of the sounds being made and how sound travels through matter.\\n\\nWe hope to foreground competing explanations in this lesson to motivate ideas for investigations that correspond to the investigations students will do in the first learning set of the unit.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nStudents may come to this unit with prior knowledge and experiences that can be leveraged. Remember not to let words or representations in students\\' models signal a false understanding of how sound works on a deep, mechanistic level. It is unlikely at this point in the unit that students are thinking of the sound waves as an emergent phenomenon that are a result of how particles of matter interact with each other. It is far more likely that they heard or read about sound being a wave or have seen a wave-like icon on their stereos or phones that represents sound. It�s important to keep pushing students to define what these waves are and how they travel and what physically is traveling from the speaker to the window and hitting the window to make it vibrate. Asking specific questions, like the following, can lead students to consider gaps in their models that the class can investigate:\\n?\\tHow could we gather evidence for the model you�ve made?\\n?\\tHow could we test or detect these kinds of waves? Could we see them if we zoomed in far enough?\\n?\\tWhat are these waves made of? How are they created?\\n?\\tAre these waves something physical? Are they made of matter? Where does the matter to make them come from?\\n?\\tWhy is it a wave and not something else?\\n?\\tWhat�s making the window move?\\n?\\tHow do these waves get picked up by our ears so we can understand the sounds being made?\\n\\nStudents may have questions and experiences with hearing that are evoked by all this discussion of sound phenomena. While this unit does not delve deeply into how sounds are received and processed by our ears and brains, it�s still productive for students to bring up these ideas in this lesson. We will address what�s happening in our ears later in the unit, and what�s happening in our ears might provide ideas about mechanisms at work across other phenomena related to how we detect sounds.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� MAKE OBSERVATIONS OF A VIDEO OF A TRUCK PLAYING LOUD MUSIC\\t8 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers, computer and projector, Truck Sound System Playing Music video\\n\\n \\nShow the truck video.?

Consider turning down the volume of this video if students may be affected by loud noises. There are additional places in this unit where you might also need to adjust the volume of sounds during lesson activities if any students experience sensitivity to loud or higher pitch noises.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlay Truck Sound System Playing Music from https://youtu.be/rlrW3PgBHLc . It is helpful to show the video first by pausing in the middle to allow students to record noticings and wonderings.\\n\\nWatch the whole video (from 00:12) a second time and allow students time to record further observations and questions. Allow students to watch the video multiple times or stop the video at key moments if doing so will help them draw out key noticings and wonderings.\\n \\n\\nTell students, Now we are going to share the noticings and wonderings we�ve made of the video. We are going to start by sharing these observations with a partner before we build a list as a whole class.\\n\\nStudents share noticings and wonderings in pairs. Once students have had enough time to closely observe this phenomenon, instruct them to share their noticings and wonderings with a partner. Show slide B. Questions on the slide can be used to frame their discussions.\\n\\nWhile students are discussing their observations and questions, walk around the room and listen to their discussions.

Show slide C. Ask students to share their noticings and wonderings of the phenomenon they observed in the video. Publicly record these ideas (e.g., using chart paper, the board, or a digital document). For each observation, ask the entire class if other student pairs also had a similar observation. Press students to provide justification for their ideas and begin to explain their observations. The goal is for students to use evidence from the video to support their ideas.?\\n \\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThis discussion should be a fluid moment for students to share their observations and consider their initial explanations and questions. The discussion should be grounded in what students notice and find interesting rather than focused on a set\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nToday�s activities rely on students communicating and articulating their thinking. One tool that may support classroom discussion is the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. This one-page document can be blown up and printed as a class poster, printed on 8.5�11 paper and posted near students� desks, and/or scaled down and taped into students� notebooks. To support student discussion and writing, reference the sentence starters on the poster and encourage students to use those sentence starters to help them communicate. These sentence starters can be especially useful for helping students engage in scientific talk, particularly students who may feel reluctant to contribute. They can also help students write about their observations, analyses, and explanations.\\n \\nquestion to frame the discussion. Consequently, the emphasis should be on eliciting and recording students� ideas and questions so the class can use these to build on as they move towards explaining the patterns they observed in the video.\\n\\nWith these priorities in mind, we do want students to begin transitioning to thinking about what�s happening to cause the\\n \\nRewatch portions of the video as needed. If students do not mention some of the aspects of the phenomenon that are important to notice, such as differences in the sound that led vibrations to start or stop, use the more general questions to prompt them to notice a particular aspect of the phenomenon.\\n\\nAs students provide their initial explanations, it is natural for questions or ideas for investigations to come up. Record these questions and ideas on the Initial Ideas for Investigation charts, respectively.\\n \\npatterns they noticed in the video. Supporting students in being specific and thoughtful about what they observed (and what questions those observations make them ask) will help drive the class towards a need to investigate what�s happening on a deeper level.\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� MAKE OBSERVATIONS OF SPEAKER MAKING SOUNDS\\t15 min\\n\\n \\n\\nIntroduce students to the speaker apparatus. The speaker device you set up is a way to recreate what happened in the truck video. Show it to students and prompt them to identify how this setup models what they saw in the video.\\n\\n\\nStudents make noticings and wonderings of the speaker apparatus. Show slide D. Ask students to create a table in their science notebooks to record their noticings and wonderings of the speaker apparatus.\\n\\nNot \\tWon \\nI no  ...\\tI wo  r ...\\n\\nTell students, As we�re making observations of this scaled-down version of what we saw in the video, let�s keep a couple of our questions in mind. We want to make noticings and wonderings about (1) what the speaker is doing when it�s making sounds and (2) what is happening while the speaker is making sounds that might help us understand what�s causing the patterns we see in the video.\\n \\n\\nHave students gather around the speaker with their notebooks to make their observations. Allow small groups of students to take turns coming closer to the setup to look at each element of the apparatus up close, especially the speaker. Have them record in their notebooks the noticings they make.\\n\\n\\nAs students are making noticings, ask questions to prompt them to consider what�s happening to cause what they notice and how it connects to what they saw in the video.\\n\\n\\nNavigate students towards making initial models. Once students have had some time to make their observations, point out that we�ve figured out more about what�s happening in the video, but we still have a lot of questions to answer. Emphasize that now is a good time to shift from noticing to trying to explain what�s causing the patterns that we observed.\\n \\n4\\t� MAKE INITIAL MODELS OF HOW THE SPEAKER MAKES THE WINDOW MOVE\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Model Diagram\\n\\nTell students, We�ve made a lot of noticings of what�s happening in this phenomenon of a car�s speaker making a faraway window move. We seem to agree on what�s happening in the video, but it sounds like we have some different ideas about how the speaker is making the window move.\\n\\nHelp students develop their initial models. Show slide E. Pass out Initial Model Diagram to students (one per student). Ask students to develop their initial models. Remind students that everyone heard the music and saw the window shaking, but we may have different explanations for why a sound coming from one thing could make another thing far away move.\\n\\nAsk students to draw on their handouts how they might explain the question, �How does the sound coming from one thing (like the speaker) make another thing far away (like the window) move?� Cue them to show what is happening in each of the three places indicated. Emphasize to students that on their\\nmodels they should be showing what�s happening at a zoomed-in scale at three places: at the surface of the speaker, in the air between the speaker and the window, and at the surface of the window. There might be points where students need to show something they can�t see. Remind students that they can use pictures, symbols, and labels to represent components they can�t see.\\n\\nAlso, direct students to use the lines below each model to write a short caption explaining what�s happening in their model. This will support their explanation and make their thinking clearer to people who might not understand their drawing alone.\\n\\nWhile students are drawing their models, walk around the room and quietly ask probing questions if there are no labels on the models.\\n\\nSuggested prompts\\n?\\tWhat did you draw in the space between the sound and the air? Can you label that?\\n?\\tWhere is the sound coming from in your model? Can you label that?\\n?\\tHow are you showing the sound moving to the window? Can you label that?\\n?\\tWhat do these lines represent? Can you label that?\\n?\\tWhat do you think is happening at the window to make it move? How can you show that?\\n\\nWhen finished, ask students to tape Initial Model Diagram into their notebooks.\\n\\nWrap up. Summarize for them what happened during the class and what will happen in the next class.\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n5\\t� SHARE AND COMPARE MODELS OF HOW THE SPEAKER MAKES THE WINDOW MOVE\\t15 min\\n\\n \\nChoose a norm to work on today. Display slide F. As students begin class today, direct them to look over the classroom norms again. Ask students to choose a norm to practice in class today. Then give students a minute to turn and talk with a partner to share the norm they selected.\\n\\n\\nRemind students of their previous work. Say, Last class, we observed a new phenomenon: We saw a speaker in a truck making a window shake in a parking lot. We also got a chance to observe a speaker like the one in the truck up close to see what it was doing when it made sounds. We had some different initial models for how the speaker is making the window move. We�re going to start today by sharing some of our ideas.\\n\\nStudents compare models with a partner.? Have students create a T-chart with similarities and differences in their notebook. Show slide G. Ask students to get out the initial models they created in the last class and compare them with a partner. Instruct students that each partner should have a minute or two to explain the thinking behind their models. While students are sharing and comparing models, they should record any similarities, differences, or questions they see between their models in a table like the one below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile students are sharing, go around and prompt students to explain what they drew and wrote on their models. Emphasize that at this point it�s key for each student to make their thinking visible so the class can see what ideas everyone agrees on and where there are still questions to figure out.\\n\\nSay, I really appreciate how you all have shared and analyzed models with a partner. It would also be helpful for all of us to analyze a few of our class�s different models together. Does anyone feel like their partner�s model would be good for all of us to take a look at?\\n\\nA few students share their models with the class. Select three or four students with different models to come up and show their models to the class and explain the elements of their models.?\\n\\nWhen a student is done presenting, ask a few students who were listening to say how their peer�s model was similar to or different from theirs. Keep track of these similarities and differences on chart paper. Also encourage students to ask clarifying questions of the students presenting.?\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nEmphasize to students that they will use models for explaining why and how phenomena occur as they do. Models need to be �applied� to be useful in explaining something, and models are most helpful when they can help us explain a lot of similar phenomena. Because students have developed their initial models, they may not be able to explain many parts of the phenomenon with confidence, and that is OK. Models are supposed to change as our knowledge grows; therefore, students will continue to revise and edit their model over the course of the unit.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe purpose of this discussion is simply to get the students to articulate parts of the model that may be in their heads but not on paper. Don�t evaluate whether the elements should or shouldn�t be there. Just help them talk out loud about everything that is in the model, and if they say something that isn�t clearly shown in the model, push them to say where in the model it appears or what they would change or add to the model to show that idea.\\n\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis is an important opportunity to emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. It is through differences in thinking that the class will grow their knowledge together. Throughout this unit, students will be asked to be open to sharing knowledge products that depict their current thinking and to be open to learning from classmates who share their knowledge too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\t� BUILD INITIAL CLASS CONSENSUS MODEL OF HOW THE SPEAKER MAKES THE WINDOW MOVE\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nEmphasize to students that when they work together to build consensus, everyone�s ideas matter. Consensus does not necessarily mean that everyone must agree on everything. Rather, consensus is needed to identify areas of common ground between ideas that may appear to differ.\\n \\nThat way we have a better sense of where we all agree and where we do not agree.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nIt is again important to accept all student responses and to encourage students to share their ideas. Further, emphasize that it is important to highlight areas of disagreement and help students clearly explicate their thinking in these areas. Accept and probe the different ideas that students propose but do not privilege �correct� ideas over others.\\nMake sure to use student language when writing on the consensus model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSay: After making noticings of the truck video and of the speaker in class making sounds, we have some ideas of what the speaker is doing when it�s making sounds and causing the window to shake from a distance. We need to figure out what parts of our explanation we agree on and what parts we need to investigate to make a full and complete model for how the speaker making sounds is causing the window to move.\\n\\nDraw and discuss the three parts of the model that all students had. Start co-constructing this model by identifying the three basic parts of the model that were part of every student�s initial model. Title this model �Initial Model for How the Speaker Made the Window Shake�. Draw in a box for a sound source and label it �speaker�. Draw in another box and label it �window�. Last, draw an arrow from the speaker to the window.\\n \\nDiscuss what is happening at the speaker or sound source.\\n\\n\\nSummarize what the class agreed upon and move on to the next part of the model. Say, So it sounds like we have agreement that the speaker is moving, but we have some questions about what the sound coming out is and how it makes different sounds. At this point your model will have question marks at the sound source (we may know what the speaker is doing, but we aren�t sure how it�s making sounds).\\n\\nDiscuss what is happening when the sound travels.\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompts\\n \\nSample student responses\\n \\nFollow-up questions\\n \\n\\n \\nHow did we think the sound was getting to the window?\\n \\nA lot of us thought there were sound waves going to the window from the speaker.\\n\\nSounds are going through the air to the window.\\n \\nIs this something everyone showed? Did we all show it the same way?\\n \\n\\nCan you show us how you represented or talked about these waves?\\n\\n \\nWhat are some differences in how you showed what was traveling?\\n \\nI showed vibrations traveling because I know that sounds come from vibrations.\\n\\nI showed these wavy lines, and they get more spread out as you go.\\n\\nI showed like little particles or dust moving. I drew like half circle lines like on a speaker.\\n \\nWhat do you mean when you say the word \\t?\\n\\nWho thinks they understand what \\t is saying and can say it in their own words?\\n\\nHmmm � so I�m hearing some people talk about waves and some people talking about little bits of stuff moving, do I have that right?\\n \\n\\nSummarize what the class agreed upon and then move to the next part of the model. Say, So we agree that the sound is traveling somehow, but we have some disagreement about what is actually traveling and how it can actually move. At this point your model will have question marks on the arrow between the sound source and our ears (we aren�t sure how to show sound moving).\\n\\nDiscuss what is happening at the window or receiver.\\n\\n \\nSuggested prompts\\n \\nSample student responses\\n \\nFollow-up questions\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat did we think was happening at the window to make it shake, like we saw in the video?\\n \\nSounds could be hitting the window to make it shake.\\n\\nVibrations from the speaker are making the window move.\\n \\nCan you say more about what you think is hitting the window?\\n\\nWhat do others think?\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat were some differences you saw in how we explained what is happening at the window?\\n \\nI showed the sound waves hitting the window and bouncing back.\\n\\nI showed the air hitting the window.\\n\\nI think the vibrations might be coming through the ground and making the window shake.\\n \\nWho can explain what \\tmeans when she says that?\\n\\nWho feels like their idea is not quite represented here?\\n \\n\\nAre there other explanations that we might want to consider?\\n\\nSummarize what the class agreed upon. Say, So it seems we have some questions about how those vibrations could make the window move. Is something hitting it? If so, what? At this point your consensus model should represent the ideas the class agreed on with question marks on the areas where students had a lot of different ideas and weren�t in consensus yet.\\n\\nSay, We have some parts that we agree on, but it definitely looks like we have a lot that still needs to be figured out in our model. In general, though, we agree that there are three things happening in our model. A sound is being made by the speaker, the sound is traveling, and the sound is doing something to the window to make it shake.\\n\\nLabel these three parts (the speaker, the arrow in the middle, and the window) on the class�s consensus model as �A�, �B�, and �C�, respectively.\\n\\nSay, Since we said the sound is coming from the speaker, let�s label the speaker (part A) as the �sound source�. Then, we can label the arrow in between (part B) as �sound traveling�. Lastly, since the sound is reaching the window, let�s call the window (part C) the �sound receiver�.\\n\\nAdd these descriptive labels to the consensus model near the labeled parts A, B, and C.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� BRAINSTORM RELATED SOUND PHENOMENA\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nSay, We agreed that we still have a lot of questions about how the speaker is making the window move. One strategy that we can use to help figure out how something works is to consider other times when we�ve seen something similar. Many times, figuring out how one thing works helps to explain a bunch of other related phenomena.\\n\\nStudents brainstorm some related phenomena. Write each of these four questions on separate chart paper and hang them in the room so they are visible to students.\\n?\\tWhen or where have you seen before a time where an object making sounds (the sound source) caused something to move or shake, like the window in the video?\\n?\\tWhen or where have you seen sounds being made before? What was making those sounds?\\n?\\tWhen or where have you experienced a sound being received before? What objects have you seen receiving sounds besides the window in the video?\\n?\\tHave you ever experienced a sound going over a distance, like in the video?\\n\\nProject slide I. Prompt students to add a �Related phenomena� section to their notebook and take a few minutes to jot down a list of similar experiences or phenomena they�ve observed that might help the class investigate what�s happening in the truck video.?\\n\\nStudents share related phenomena. Show slide J. When students are finished brainstorming, have them go around to each poster and write one of their responses somewhere on the poster in a list below the question. Alternatively, you could ask them to write their ideas on sticky notes and post those on the posters.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: When brainstorming related phenomena, students can leverage lived experiences that are personally and culturally meaningful to them in order to generate an expanded sphere of phenomena that the class will work together to explain. Including this routine in Lesson 1 allows students to share the understanding and perspective they bring to the classroom with their classmates and promotes engagement since the class�s work will be leveraged to explain something meaningful to each student. It�s important to note that this routine encourages students to surface phenomena that are familiar to them, and that these phenomena may be personally or culturally significant to students. The phenomena that students brainstorm and connect to the truck video are fundamentally linked to those students�\\n \\ncultural, racial, and socioeconomic contexts. Encourage students to draw connections to their lived experience to generate a list of related phenomena that�s inclusive of all students and that provides all students with inroads to engage with this new topic of study.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL SOUND-RELATED QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n \\n9\\t� DISCUSS QUESTIONS TO POST ON DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t7 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, sticky notes\\n\\n \\nPrepare for the Driving Question Board (DQB). Find a place where all students can gather around the DQB. Place the Initial Class Consensus Model poster in the center of the Driving Question Board.\\n\\nReturn to the questions students generated earlier and develop new questions. Say, Last class, we brainstormed a lot of questions about the truck video, the speaker, and other similar phenomena. Today, we�re going to post our sound-related questions to our Driving Question Board and begin thinking about how we�re going to investigate to figure out what�s happening when sounds make something from a distance move.\\n\\nAsk students to look back at the questions they jotted down last time on their notebooks.\\n\\nProject slide L. Instruct students to use the question starters on the slide to draft two questions to contribute to the class Driving Question Board. These questions can be ones they brainstormed last class, perhaps revised based on the suggested question starters, or they can be new sound-related questions. Ask students to write their questions in marker on index card�sized sticky notes (or index cards), one per note. They should write their questions so they are big and bold�we want to be able to see the questions, and they need to be large enough to view when we come in the classroom door. Remind students that it is part of our mission to try to answer these questions.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emergent multilinguals: Asking questions in everyday language allows students to share their thinking or experiences, even if they do not have the appropriate scientific vocabulary yet. This is helpful for emergent multilingual students because, by not requiring scientific words at the onset, you do not limit their participation in classroom discourse. These sentence starters can help students transform freely brainstormed questions into a format that can be investigated in future lessons. This works to ensure student engagement through investigative questions within the scope of the classroom.\\n \\n\\n10\\t� POST QUESTIONS TO DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t23 min\\n\\n\\n?

Tell students that we now have initial models, ideas for investigations, and a lot of questions. Suggest to students that we look back at our list of questions and the investigations to see where we should start.\\n\\nSay, it looks like we have questions about all three parts of our model for how sound from one object can make another object move. To explain this phenomenon, we�re going to have to investigate all three of these parts. Since we already investigated the sound source by making observations of the speaker, it seems like that part of our model is a good place to start.\\n\\nSuggested prompts\\tSample student responses\\n\\nWhy might it be helpful to start by investigating the sound source?\\tWe should start with investigating the sound source because that�s\\nwhere the sound comes from to make something like the window move.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nAt the end of this lesson, students agree that the class needs to investigate some other sound-makers. If students are interested and able, you may consider having some students bring in instruments that they are familiar with to allow the class to closely examine. Having students bring in instruments that are meaningful to them is one way to encourage students to engage with the work the class is doing. Often, students bring in instruments that they have experienced at home or in their community,\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe began investigating how sound sources make sounds by making observations of the speaker. What other investigations could we do to better understand how sounds get made by\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is it important to check out other sound sources besides the speaker?\\n \\n\\nAfter we understand the sound source works, we can figure out how the sound travels and how it makes stuff move.\\n\\nMaybe investigating the sound source will help us see how the sound starts to travel. That could help us with other parts of the model, too.\\n\\nWe could make observations of other sound sources to see what they do when they make sounds.\\n\\nWe could watch videos of sounds being made to see if the same things happen that we saw when we observed the speaker.\\n\\nThe speaker is just one sound source. We don�t know if all sound sources work the same.\\n\\nIf we had more than one sound source, we could be more sure about the observations we make about how sounds are produced.\\n \\nand this can provide insight for the class into the cultural connections that people make with different modes of music and different instruments.\\n\\nIf your students are unable to bring in instruments from home or music class, try to select a couple example instruments that may be culturally relevant for the students in your class. Being mindful about including these instruments will help students to forge connections between phenomena in class and experiences that are personally or culturally meaningful to them.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat kinds of sound sources would we want to check out? How could we observe what�s happening with them when they make sounds?\\n \\nWe could check out things that make sounds, like instruments. Maybe we could borrow some from the music room or from our classmates.?\\n\\nWe could look up close at the different sound-makers to see what they do when they make sounds.\\n\\nMaybe we could get a zoomed-in video or a slow-motion video to get a better idea of what�s happening when sounds are being made.\\n \\n\\n\\nWrap up the lesson. Remind students that they have come a long way in a few classes. They have seen an interesting phenomenon, come to some agreement on what they think they know, generated questions, and posed some ideas of what to investigate and where to go next.\\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n \\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.8.1.C: Pose questions that connect the ideas of several speakers and respond to others\\' questions and comments with relevant evidence, observations, and ideas.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the DQB, if a student forgets to explain why or how his or her question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through his or her own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off each other�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that are not part of topics in this unit. Over time students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question. This type of activity gives them practice at doing that.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n \\n \\nLesson 1: What causes a speaker to vibrate?\\n\\n \\n\\nPrevious Lesson  There is no previous lesson.\\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\n\\n\\nWe are introduced to an anchoring phenomenon: a speaker vibrating using a magnet and a coil of wire. We dissect a speaker to identify the important parts of the system. Then we make a speaker that uses the same parts as the store-bought speaker. We brainstorm how magnets and electricity in the coil of wire could work together to cause the speaker to vibrate. This sparks a broader set of questions about magnets, electricity, and forces, which helps us form our Driving Question Board (DQB). We use a cause-effect scaffold to develop additional questions that focus on cause-and-effect relationships in the system.\\n \\n\\n\\nNext Lesson  We will experiment with several objects to establish that while certain metals do interact with magnets, including other magnets, the copper coil will not until it is connected to a battery. We will change the direction of these forces by changing the orientation of either the magnet or the coil of wire.\\n\\n \\n\\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-PS2-3, MS-PS2-5, MS-PS3-2\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tDevelop an initial model to describe how interactions between parts of a speaker system (magnet and coil of wire) cause sound without those parts touching each other.\\n\\n1.B\\tAsk questions about how interactions between parts of a speaker system (magnet and coil of wire) cause sound without those parts touching each other.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tA speaker is a system with parts that include a magnet, a coil of wire, and a speaker cone.\\n?\\tWhen the coil of wire is connected to a sound source, the speaker cone vibrates to produce sound, but only when a magnet is brought very near to the wire.\\n?\\tThe magnet and the coil of wire do not need to be touching to make the speaker cone vibrate.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Learning Plan Snapshot\\nPart\\tDuration\\tSummary\\tSlide\\tMaterials\\n1\\t15 min\\tINTRODUCE THE SPEAKER\\nObserve a slow-motion video of a speaker playing music.

Be prepared to add magnet, wire, speaker to the class Word Wall.\\nDay 1: Speaker Dissection\\n?\\tGroup size: Whole class\\n?\\tSetup\\n1.\\tThe speaker dissection is best as a real-time investigation to do with your students. However, there are two alternative approaches to the speaker dissection: using a previously dissected speaker or playing a video of a speaker dissection. If you select an alternative approach, the advance preparation is different. Watch the speaker dissection video yourself to orient yourself to how you would do it as a real-time investigation with students: https://youtu.be/6MMwKN9TaVU\\n \\n2.\\tIf you want a larger speaker to dissect, use an old stereo speaker purchased at a thrift store (~$5). Otherwise, use the 4-inch speaker provided in your kit.\\n3.\\tIf you purchase a speaker from a thrift store, remove the grill and housing prior to the dissection. If there is an amplifier inside, remove this too if possible. This will speed the dissection and focus students on the fundamental parts of the speaker and not the exterior components.\\n4.\\tHave scissors and a screwdriver handy to aid in the dissection.\\n\\nDay 1: Homemade cup speaker Group size: Whole class\\n?\\tSetup\\n1.\\tBuild a homemade speaker using the steps in the teacher guide. Check ahead of time to make sure it works. Use https://youtu.be/VGa1lmULSZ4 if you are having trouble removing the enamel from the wire.\\n2.\\tSet up one or two sound testing stations where groups of students can easily hook their cup speaker to a device to test whether their speaker works. Consider having more than one station if you have a large class and many groups. Watch Lesson 1 - Video C - Sound test cup speaker https://youtu.be/gJM1M-ETIfw to see how this will work. The station(s) will need the following setup:\\n?\\ta device that can play music and has a standard audio jack output (e.g., computer, tablet, old phone, Walkman)\\n?\\tpreselected audio to play on the device, like a song (Find open source music selections here: https://musopen.org/, or choose a song or audio file from your own music library. Preview the music choice to ensure it is appropriate for your students.)\\n?\\tstereo audio auxiliary cable (two male ends) to connect to the cup speaker (Watch Lesson 1 - Video A - Prep for cup speaker https://youtu.be/o6qhWv4utbU to see how to prep the cables and other cup materials.) To prepare the cables, do the following:\\n?\\tCut the stereo audio auxiliary cable in half. This will give you 2 pieces of audio cable that could be used at 2 testing stations. Each will be about 2 feet in length.\\n?\\tOn each half, strip the black plastic covering to expose the two colored wires inside (one white and one red) that also will have plastic covering. They may be surrounded by either a layer of foil or some very fine copper fibers. This is a layer of shielding that needs to be cut off; remove that material if it is there. Strip at least 1 inch of the red and white plastic coverings off of each to reveal the copper wire inside. There may be a third wire (yellow) that is the ground wire. Strip the end of the yellow covering too.\\n?\\tConnect each exposed copper wire end to an alligator clip (red wire to one clip, white wire to the other clip; if there is a yellow wire, run it with either the red or white wire). Make sure the red and white wires are not in contact.\\n?\\tStudents will hook their cup speaker to the other end of the alligator clip.\\n?\\tWatch this video: https://youtu.be/o6qhWv4utbU to see how to coil the wire and prep the electromagnet for the speaker. It is suggested that you have students complete this step in class; though, you can choose to prep these coils ahead of time if necessary.\\n?\\tNote there is another cable option demonstrated in this video: https://youtu.be/gJM1M-ETIfw that uses other materials in lieu of the stereo audio auxiliary cable.\\n?\\tPrepare lab bins for holding and transporting the cup speakers for each group. Each group of students will need a bin of supplies. The bin should include 1 9-oz plastic cup, 1 D-cell battery (or 1-inch tube), 1 2�-�-2� piece of sandpaper, and 12 feet of magnetic wire (28 gauge). Groups also need access to tape to attach the coil of wire to the bottom of their cups.\\n?\\tWatch this video https://youtu.be/7hFb4_QAGNE to get an idea of how students will build their speakers.\\n?\\tRead more about building the homemade cup speaker at https://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/cup-speaker.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nVibrations from a speaker cone are due to an external force exerted on the speaker cone. This force comes from interactions between parts inside the speaker. The main parts of any speaker include a magnet and a coil of wire nestled near the magnet. The magnet and wire are not touching, but they are very close to each other. A speaker can work with any magnet and coil of wire hooked up to the two signal output lines from an electronic music player as long as the magnet is placed near the wire.\\n\\nIn the next several lessons, students will discover that magnets exert forces on some objects without touching those objects, such as an attractive force on some metals, which is a pull between the magnet and the metal object. This is probably something that many students have figured out intuitively already, either through experience with refrigerator magnets or from earlier grades. Students may also know that if you reverse the orientation of the magnets (the poles), you can get either a push or a pull occurring between them. Many students will likely believe that magnets attract all metals, which is a productive idea to investigate in Lesson 2. Having a shared experience to make these ideas explicit in Lesson 2 and establish explicit patterns will help students make connections between their intuitive understanding of what magnets do and their emerging ideas about forces and energy.\\n\\nThroughout this unit, students will be reminded of what they learned in OpenSciEd Unit 8.1: Why do things sometimes get damaged when they hit each other? (Collisions Unit) about paired forces (Newton�s third law): When the magnet puts a force on the coil of wire, the coil of wire also puts a force on the magnet. They will use the idea that forces can transfer energy to make something move to think about the system in terms of energy transfer from a magnetic field into the moving speaker.\\n\\nStudents bring a model for how contact forces interact with each other to the study of this unit. They will have knowledge about how balanced and unbalanced forces acting on objects can deform objects and how unbalanced forces on an object result in changes to the motion of that object. They will readily know that a force can be a push or a pull. And they will know that any sound source that vibrates must be moved or deformed by either a push or a pull. This includes the speaker cone.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nStudents have developed a model for sound in OpenSciEd Unit 8.2: How can a sound make something move? (Sound Unit) that includes how collisions among particles of air (or other medium) result in matter compression bands spanning across space that propagate across the medium over time. They may believe the speaker works because there are similar particle collisions happening in the air between the magnet and the wire. Over time students leave this model behind and figure out that the magnet and wire interact with each other even in a vacuum where no air exists between them (Lesson 3).\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� INTRODUCE THE SPEAKER\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Speaker in Slow-Motion video, music-playing device\\n\\n \\nElicit initial ideas to make connections to the unit on sound. Begin by revisiting a phenomenon students saw in the unit How can we detect sound from a distance? to engage students� ideas about how speakers work. Say, Ever since we finished learning about sound, I can�t help noticing speakers everywhere I look.? We use speakers every day. What do we already know about how speakers make sound? Elicit 2-3 student responses. Then focus students� attention on slide A (you can replace the image on the slide with your class model for the speaker). Review the consensus model from the Sound Unit. Focus on what students figured out about the speaker.\\n\\nSay, Let�s go back to some of the ideas we had about speakers. We decided that for anything that produces sound, there has to be a force that is applied to the sound source to deform or bend it to get it to start vibrating. We identified what that force was for many instruments, but I don\\'t think that we ever identified what the force was that was being applied to the speaker that caused it to vibrate.?\\n\\nDisplay slide B, which asks, How could we investigate what is causing the speaker to vibrate? Ask students to turn and talk with a partner for a minute to share ideas.? Then regroup to share out. Listen for student ideas about investigations, such as these:\\n?\\tWe could make observations of a speaker vibrating.\\n?\\tWe could watch a slow-motion video of a speaker to see where the force is happening.\\n?\\tWe could ask someone who makes or installs speakers.\\n?\\tWe could take the speaker apart and look inside.\\n\\nObservations of a speaker. Tell students that the class can do some of these investigations now to gather more information about the force, such as viewing the slow-motion video they may have seen in the previous unit about sound propagation. As you pull up the video, tell students to find a new page in their science notebook and label it �Observing a Speaker in Slow Motion.� Under the title, they should create a table like the one on slide C with columns �What I notice� and �What I wonder.� They will use this table to record observations from the video and any questions that they think about while they make their observations.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nStudents will find the anchoring phenomenon more compelling if it is presented in a meaningful context. Ask students where they see speakers every day. Students may suggest the speakers in their phones, their headphones, the school loudspeaker, a bluetooth speaker, or a sound system at home.\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS INITIAL IDEAS DISCUSSION\\n\\nThe purpose of this brief discussion is to (1) give students a chance to reflect on what they already know about forces and sound from previous units and (2) motivate the dissection of the speaker by revealing a gap in what we know (the cause of the force in the speaker). Ask, what causes the force in a drum (or a recorder)? This will engage students in retrieving ideas from the previous units and remind the class that forces are typically caused by contact (between the hand and the drum or the air and the recorder).\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPlay the Speaker in Slow-Motion video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2BUvWRCBGM with the sound muted. Have students add to their observation table as they watch the video. Then, play the video a second time with the sound on so that students can match their visual observations with auditory ones.\\n\\nPrompt students to record additional observations and questions. Give students time (about 1 minute) to share their observations with a partner, then have 2 or 3 students share what they discussed with the whole group.?\\n\\nAsk students to share new ideas they have about what is causing the force(s) that vibrate the speaker. Listen for student responses like the following:\\n?\\tElectricity from the computer/device causes it.\\n?\\tSome kind of electronics inside the speaker causes it.\\n?\\tSomething inside is pushing (or pulling) on it.\\n?\\tThere are air particles moving/vibrating inside it, which is vibrating the speaker.\\n?\\tThere is sound moving down the wires to the speaker.\\n\\nTransition to the speaker dissection. This transition will vary depending on whether you plan to (1) dissect a speaker in real time, (2) use a speaker you have already dissected, or (3) play a video of a speaker dissection.\\n\\n?\\tIf you plan to dissect the speaker in real time, say, Some of you mentioned wanting to take a speaker apart and look inside. Let�s try that out. Let�s make some additional observations of the parts we find inside of it and see if that can help us figure out more about how it works.\\n?\\tIf you plan to use a previously dissected speaker, say, Some of you mentioned wanting to take a speaker apart and look inside. I thought you might be interested in that, so I took one apart earlier. Let�s make some additional observations of the parts we find inside of it and see if that can help us figure out more about how it works.\\n \\nSupporting emergent multilinguals: It is important to organize activities in ways that create opportunities for students to engage in meaningful, accountable talk by emphasizing socially safe activity structures (e.g., small-group or partner work before a whole-class discussion). This is especially beneficial to emergent multilingual students. Strive to give students an opportunity to share their ideas with one or two peers before going public with the whole class.\\nEncourage small groups of students to communicate using any combination of the languages and registers with which they feel comfortable.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nAn optional, second investigation is to connect a speaker to your music-playing device and play a song for your students. If students lightly touch the speaker, they can feel the vibrations. This could be particularly powerful for students who are visually or hearing impaired. Use the stereo audio cable and alligator clips along with a 4-inch speaker (this could be the same speaker you plan to dissect) to play the music. If you select this option, plan for an additional 5-10 minutes for this part of the lesson.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� SPEAKER DISSECTION DEMO\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: Speaker Dissection Demo, science notebook\\n\\n \\nObservations of a dissected speaker. Have tools handy for taking the speaker apart, such as a screwdriver and scissors or a knife. Remove the grill and housing from the speaker ahead of time. This will save time to focus on the important parts inside the speaker. Ask students to gather around for the dissection or project the dissection on a document camera. Before you begin, ask students, How could taking a speaker apart help us figure out what is causing the force that is vibrating the speaker? What do we think we�re going to find inside the speaker? Accept all responses.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nIt is possible that some students may feel uncomfortable disassembling a perfectly good speaker. If this comes up, be sensitive to students� discomfort. Consider reusing one speaker across classes so that it feels less wasteful, or clarifying that this speaker is no longer useful. You can play the Dissecting a Speaker video instead, but this may be less engaging to students. The most important purpose of this activity is to let students see inside the speaker to identify the important parts.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, gently cut the paper speaker cone from the speaker basket (the metal frame) and lift the cone to show students what is inside. It will not come completely apart until you cut the spider (the ribbed ring of paper around the coil) from the basket.\\n \\n\\nSecond, gently cut the spider from the speaker basket. The spider�s main function is to hold the center voice coil in place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLift the spider and voice coil from inside the speaker. Allow students time to make observations of the tiny coil of wire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing a metal tool, like a screwdriver, tap on the center magnet in the speaker basket. It�s difficult to remove the magnet and sufficient to show students that it is a magnet without removing it. Your screwdriver should stick to the magnet, which is a good way to show students the magnet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nConsider why the parts of the system help us figure out how it works. Briefly ask, why are we identifying the parts of the system? What are some other times that examining the structure of a system help us figure out how the system functions? Accept 2-3 student responses and move on. Students might suggest scenarios such as:\\n?\\tdissection in biology\\n?\\ta doctor taking an X-ray to diagnose an illness\\n?\\ta mechanic taking apart a car to identify a car issue?\\n\\nIdentify the parts of the speaker. Lay out the important parts of the speaker, including the coil of wire, the magnet-basket combination, and the paper speaker cone. As you identify each part, place by it an index card with the part name written on it. At this point, use language that comes from the class rather than imposing vocabulary that students will earn in the unit.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION\\n\\nCross-cutting concepts can be used to intentionally and explicitly make\\n \\nconnections across science domains and other disciplines. Although structure and function are not foregrounded in this unit, take this opportunity to help students see that the structure of the system can help us figure out how it functions. This is also an opportunity to help students make connections across OpenSciEd units. For example, you can encourage students to think about how looking at the parts of McKenna�s digestive system helped us understand how it worked in OpenSciEd Unit\\n7.3: How do things inside our bodies work together to make us feel the way we do? (Inside Our Bodies Unit)\\n\\n3\\t� MODEL THE SPEAKER SYSTEM INDIVIDUALLY\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nSystems and systems models are a focal crosscutting concept for this unit. A system is an organized group of related objects or components. Here we refer to those objects or components as parts. Scientists use models to understand and predict the behavior of systems. The first step in modeling a system in order to understand it is to figure out the important parts of the system. This allows scientists to study how the parts interact to produce the emergent behavior of the system as a whole. Help students set up their initial models as\\n \\nsystems models by identifying the important parts of each system and thinking about how those parts work together (interact).\\n\\n4\\t� IDENTIFY THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM\\t13 min\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of the system\\tWhy is it important?\\tQuestions\\nCoil\\tIt is metal, and it is connected to the music player.\\tIs there electricity in it?

Say, Last time, we identified the most important parts of a speaker. We decided that the magnet, the coil, and the speaker cone worked together somehow to produce forces that caused the sound. It turns out that with those three simple parts, we can actually make our own speakers. So I thought today we could try to build our own homemade speakers.\\n\\nIntroduce the homemade speaker. Say, I tried building one of these before class started. Show students the main parts of the speaker and ask students if they notice similarities to the store-bought speaker (e.g., the cup is like the speaker cone, the wire at the base is like the coil of wire, and the magnet is like the magnet in the metal frame). Say, I am going to give you all a chance to build speakers of your own, and then we can see if something this simple can actually make sound!\\n\\nBefore sending students to groups, remind them why we are building the speaker. Display slide F. Say, How do you think building a homemade speaker could give us more clues about what is producing the force or forces that cause speakers (in general) to vibrate?\\n\\nListen for student responses like the following:\\n?\\tWhen you build things, you can see how the parts fit together.\\n?\\tWe can figure out the most important parts inside the speaker.\\n?\\tWe might be able to see if the wire and magnet are connected.\\n?\\tWe could see where the electricity is going inside the speaker.\\n \\n \\n\\n6\\t� BUILDING A HOMEMADE SPEAKER\\t20 min\\n\\n \\n\\nUse the sandpaper to rub the enamel off the ends of the wire. You should see copper wire underneath.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTape the coil to the bottom of your cup.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttach the two free ends of wire on your cup speaker to the two alligator clips at the sound testing station. Put the magnets near the wire to see what happens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs students test their speakers, ask them to move the disk magnets near and far away from the cup and wire. This will affect how loud the sound is coming from it. Let other students listen to the speaker.\\n\\n\\nRevise their initial models. Collect all the cup speakers from the groups. The cups and coils of wire will be reused in subsequent labs.\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� COMPARING SPEAKERS\\t15 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat was similar/different about the magnets?\\n \\nBoth were round. When you moved them closer together, the music got louder.\\nOne magnet was stuck to the speaker basket and the other magnet could move close or far.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat was similar/different about the coil of wire?\\n \\nBoth were coiled up.\\nThe coil is smaller in the store speaker and bigger in the homemade speaker.\\n \\n\\n \\nAre there any parts that we listed as important that we don�t think are important anymore?\\n \\nThe spider (or paper around the coil) wasn�t important because it wasn�t part of the homemade speaker.\\n \\n\\nMaking sense of the speaker. After several students have had the opportunity to share their ideas, and some competing ideas have surfaced, conclude the discussion using the following prompts (show slide I):\\n?\\tHow did building the speaker help you understand the important parts of the system better?\\n?\\tWhat questions came up for you as you built the speaker and compared it to the store-bought speaker?\\n?\\tHow do you think the magnet and wire work together without touching each other?\\n\\nSummarize for students by saying, It seems like we learned that speakers have to have a couple of key parts to work, like the magnet and the wire and the cone. We have some ideas about how the cup speaker worked, but we aren�t sure. When a hand hits a drum, it puts a force on a drum and the drum puts a force on the hand. When a phone collides with the ground, the ground puts a force on a phone and the phone puts a force on the ground. Both of these are examples of contact forces. But in this case, the magnet doesn�t have to be touching the wire to get it moving. We should investigate more how it could be possible for there to be forces between two things that aren�t touching each other.\\n\\nRemind students to leave their science notebooks in the classroom so you can look at their models before the next class period.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n8\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL FOR THE SPEAKER\\t25 min\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nIn this unit students will engage several times in modeling (SEP) of a system (CCC) to explain how forces act at a distance (DCI). Their initial models may only include parts of the system and amorphous references to how they interact, but over time, they will begin to incorporate invisible cause and effect mechanisms (CCC) in the magnetic field (DCI). Because students have developed only their initial models, they may not be able to incorporate DCIs to\\n \\nRemind students of the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters.? Make certain a Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout is visible. Emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. Ask them which sentence starters they might want to use to help them talk to one another. Examples include these:\\n\\nThink of an idea, claim, prediction, or model to explain your data and observations:\\n?\\tMy idea is �.\\n?\\tI think that �.\\n?\\tWe could draw it this way � to show ....\\n\\nGive evidence for your idea or claim:\\n?\\tMy evidence is �.\\n?\\tThe reason I think that is �.\\n\\nOther examples could come from (1) listening to others� ideas and asking clarifying questions, (2) agreeing or disagreeing with others� ideas, and (3) adding onto others� ideas.\\n \\nexplain the phenomenon with confidence yet. That is OK. Models and explanations are supposed to change as our knowledge grows.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: You may use color coding to foreground parts of the model. Although color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding helps ensure accessibility for any student who may be color-blind. Create a key to track what colors, symbols, numbers, or letters represent different parts of the system.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPresent slide K to review the purpose of a Consensus Discussion. Tell students that the goal of this discussion is to determine areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models to help us decide how to proceed in figuring out how the speaker works.\\n\\n\\n? STRATEGIES FOR THIS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\n\\nIn a Consensus Discussion, it is important to accept all student responses and to encourage students to share their ideas. Help students to articulate their ideas clearly in order to highlight areas of disagreement and areas of agreement. Be careful not to favorably respond to any one idea over\\n \\nInitial sharing of models. Pick three students with different models to come up and show their models to the class. Try to pick examples that show different ideas and mechanisms than the others. When students share, they should explain all the elements in their models. Use probing questions to get them to articulate each piece of the model. After each presentation, ask students to look at their own model and the one that was just presented to find similarities and differences between them. If something is repeated in multiple models, emphasize that to the class or ask students to share what was common across the shared models. When all three presentations are done, transition to developing a class consensus model.\\n\\nCreate an initial model. Prepare to draw a sketch of the speaker system on chart paper that has been titled �Initial Speaker System Model.� Point students to the list the class made of important parts of the speaker (see slide E) to help decide which parts of the system to include (e.g., magnet, coil of wire, speaker cone). Remind students, When we are identifying important parts of the system, let�s ask ourselves what would happen if the part were not there. Would it change the outcome? If so, the part is probably important.?\\n\\nTo document the class�s initial ideas, have students focus first on the similarities in their models. As students come to agreement on parts of the model, draw a diagrammatic model to represent everything that students agree upon (e.g., the parts of the model, where they are located in relation to one another, whether the magnet and coil of wire need to be close but not touching, electricity going to the speaker, and so forth). There may be very little at this point that students agree upon.\\n \\nothers so as not to �give away� what might be going on in the speaker.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecord the initial consensus model in students� progress trackers. Ask students to turn to the first page of their progress trackers, and make a line about a third of the way across the page. Students should record the lesson question on the left side of the line. On the right side, ask them to record an initial model for the speaker.\\n\\n9\\t� BROADENING TO RELATED PHENOMENA\\t12 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers, Related Phenomena poster (developed in this lesson)\\n\\n \\nStay in a Scientists Circle to identify related phenomena. Prompt students to think about examples of other objects that they suspect use magnets and/or wire to make the object or some part(s) of the object move. Present slide L. Ask, Where else have we seen these same kinds of parts in a different system making something move?\\n\\nHave students turn and talk about their ideas before sharing out with the whole group. Accept all student responses. Record students� ideas on chart paper using a table like the one shown below. If you haven�t already, title the poster �Related Phenomena.� If students note objects that use both magnets and wires together, ask them to think about how the two work together to help make the object or part of the object move (e.g., metal detector, earbuds, sprinklers, pinball machine, scrapyard magnet).?\\n\\nWhat is the system? Which parts move?\\tHow does it move?\\tAre the parts of the system touching?\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nConclude the discussion by saying, It seems like either magnets or wires or a combination of both together can produce a force or forces that can make things move. If we can figure out what the magnets and wire are doing in the speaker, we might be able to figure out how they can be used in other systems to move things too.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUse talk strategies to elicit a variety of related phenomena from students.\\n?\\tIf it feels like students don�t have any more ideas, don�t move on right away. Instead, count to ten in your head to give students more time to consider.\\n?\\tHave students jot down ideas in their notebooks after their partner talk and before sharing out. This can be particularly supportive for emergent multilingual students.\\n?\\tUse questions to push students� thinking to new contexts and provide opportunities to make connections to their experiences. For example, if students are only naming kitchen appliances, say, It seems like our examples are pretty small. Can anybody think of something that uses magnets or electricity to move something big?\\n \\n\\n10\\t� NAVIGATION\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n \\n11\\t� DEVELOP QUESTIONS FOR THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: sticky notes, markers, chart paper, Initial Speaker System Model poster (developed in this lesson), Related Phenomena poster (developed in this lesson)\\n\\n \\nReorient to the unit question. Display slide N. Say, Last class we wrote down our unit question. What do we need to know in order to answer this question? Have students turn and talk with their partners or in small table groups to brainstorm for two minutes.\\n\\nSay, Today we will create our Driving Question Board and brainstorm some ideas for investigations that we can do in order to figure this out.\\n\\nWrite initial questions for the DQB. Make sure the Related Phenomena poster and the class� Initial Speaker System Model are posted at the front of the room where students can see them. Display slide O. Then pass out 3-4 sticky notes and a marker to each student. Ask students to write one or two questions on the notes about the speaker system, a part of the speaker system, or related phenomena. They should record only one question per note. They should write their questions big and bold�we want to be able to see the questions clearly.\\n\\nEstablish a shared understanding of cause and effect. Say, When scientists ask questions about a system, they are usually looking to identify cause-and-effect relationships. Let�s think about the speaker system in terms of possible cause-and-effect relationships that we might want to know more about.?\\n\\nDisplay slide P. Say, Before we begin brainstorming, let�s come up with a shared understanding of what a cause-and-effect relationship is. A\\ncause-and-effect relationship describes what happens to a system when you change it. It can usually be described with a statement that sounds like this: When we change this, then we observe that.\\n?\\tWhen I drop my phone on a hard surface, then I observe the screen shatter.\\n?\\tWhen I turn the key in the classroom door, then I observe the lock open.\\nTurn to a partner and share an example of a cause-and-effect relationship in your everyday life using an �when this, we will observe that� statement.\\n\\nAfter students share with their partner, solicit 2-3 student ideas quickly, then display slide Q. Ask, Is there a cause-effect statement that we can definitely make about the speaker right now? Is there a change that we could make to the system where we know for sure what we will observe if we make that change? Turn to your partner and discuss for a minute, then write down at least one example in your notebooks under the title\\n�Cause-and-Effect Observations.�\\n\\nAfter about two minutes, solicit 2-3 student ideas for cause-effect statements about the speaker. Look for students to suggest things like these:\\n?\\tWhen we turn off the music player, we observe that the music stops.\\n?\\tWhen we move the magnet away, we observe that the music stops.\\n?\\tWhen we move the magnet closer to the coil, we observe that the music gets louder.\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nCause and effect is a focal crosscutting concept for this unit. Revealing causal relationships and the mechanisms that connect cause to effect is a major activity of science and engineering. The\\nfill-in-the-blank scaffold introduced here will eventually become a table that students use to organize their thinking about the interactions in a system. They will come back to this table frequently. In Lessons 10 and 11, this cause-effect scaffold will support students in determining independent and dependent variables and writing investigable questions to determine the nature of the relationship between these variables.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nAsking questions is a focal practice in this unit. In middle school, the NGSS specifies that as part of the development of this practice, students are expected to �frame a hypothesis based on observations and scientific principles� but only �when appropriate.� These words are chosen carefully, because asking questions, making predictions, and framing hypotheses are not\\n \\nRecord these statements at the front of the room (e.g., on chart paper). After writing each student example, pause to point out the cause, or change to the system (e.g., turning off the music player), and the effect we observe (e.g., the music stops).\\n\\nDisplay slide R. Say, There are a lot of ways that scientists ask questions about cause-and-effect relationships in systems. We could ask a question about the effect. We could ask a question about the change we need to make to get the effect. We could also ask a how or why question about a cause-and-effect relationship we are pretty sure about. Can anybody take one of these statements at the front of the room and explain why the change we made to the system causes the effect? Turn to a partner and discuss.?\\n\\n\\nGive students a couple of minutes to discuss. Meanwhile, walk around the room, using probing questions to help clarify student ideas to reveal gaps in their understanding. For example, if a student says that the music stops when the magnet is removed because the magnet is pulling on the coil and causing the vibration of the speaker, challenge the student to explain the mechanism or push them for evidence. The goal of the exercise is to reveal how little we know about the mechanisms underlying these cause-and-effect relationships.\\n\\nBring the class back together and display slide S. Say, I�ve added the word because to our cause-effect sentence for when we have an explanation that connects cause and effect. It seems like we still have a lot of questions about how and why these changes to the system cause these effects. We can describe cause-and-effect relationships that we observe or predict using just �if� and �then�, but as we dive deeper into our investigations, I hope we will also start to fill in some becauses.\\n\\n\\nWrite questions for the DQB based on cause and effect.? Point to the examples on the slide. Say, Here are some question frames that we can use to ask about cause and effect.\\n\\n1.\\tWhat is the effect when we make this change?\\n2.\\tWhat is the change we would need to make to get this effect? What part(s) of the system is involved in this change?\\n3.\\tDoes this change cause this effect?\\n4.\\tHow or why does this change cause this effect?\\n\\nPass out another one or two sticky notes to each student.? Ask students to write one or two new questions on the notes, one question per note, using the cause-effect framework to reveal what we don�t know and want to know more about.\\n \\nthe same thing. It is important to note the distinction between the types of predictions and questions students have been making up until now, and the hypotheses they will write in this unit, starting in Lesson 3.\\nAccording to Appendix H of the NGSS, a hypothesis is an �idea that may contribute important new knowledge for the evaluation of a scientific theory� (p. 5). It is not simply the articulation of a pattern, but rather the articulation of a pattern that if established, would lend support to a mechanistic model/explanation for a phenomenon.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN THREE-DIMENSIONAL LEARNING\\n\\nThe cause-effect scaffold is used in several ways across this unit. Each version of the scaffold has slightly different sentence structure and syntax:\\n?\\tStudents use �when we...we observe�� syntax to describe cause-and-effect relationships very generally and to support the development of questions about cause-and-effect relationships (e.g. this lesson).\\n?\\tStudents use �when we�.we will observe�� to make predictions (e.g. lesson 2).\\n \\n\\t\\t?\\tStudents frame hypotheses using the\\nframe �if�..then when we�..we will observe��, which includes not only an observable cause-effect pattern but also the mechanistic explanation that we hope to uncover through an investigation that establishes the\\n \\npattern (e.g. lesson 3).\\nSee Using Cause-Effect Scaffolds to Support Science and Engineering Practices for more detail on how these sentence frames are used across the unit to support student sense-making and engagement in the science and engineering practices.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN ASKING QUESTIONS AND DEFINING PROBLEMS\\n\\nThe purpose of this activity is to support students in asking questions about phenomena that will lead to investigations by making connections to the crosscutting concept of cause and effect. These should be questions that (1) we can answer through investigation and (2) will help us explain how these things work the way they do. Tell students that they can rewrite their old questions right now or come up with a new question. Remind them that there are many valuable questions that we can come up with that don�t fit the cause-effect framework, and that is fine too.\\n\\n12\\t� DEVELOP THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t15 min\\n\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n \\nSystems and systems thinking is a focal crosscutting concept in this unit. As students ask questions, have them reflect on any parts of the speaker system (or related systems) that have few or no questions posted on the DQB. Prompt students to generate more questions in this space so that each important part of the system is to be investigated.\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� PLAN IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t13 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� NAVIGATION\\t2 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.6.1.c: Pose and respond to specific questions with elaboration and detail by making comments that contribute to the topic, text, or issue under discussion.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the Driving Question Board, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off one another�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nDon�t worry if some questions are raised that do not lead to productive investigations. Over time students will get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question. This type of activity gives them practice at doing that.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n\\nToday�s activities rely on students communicating and articulating their thinking. One tool that may support classroom discussion is the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters. This 1-page document can be blown up and printed as a class poster, printed on 8.5-�-11 paper and posted near students� desks, and/or scaled down and taped into students� science notebooks. To support discussion, reference the sentence starters on the poster and encourage students to use those sentence starters to help them communicate. The sentence starters can be especially useful for helping students engage in scientific talk, particularly students who may feel reluctant to contribute.\\n \\n \\nLesson 1: How are we connected to the patterns we see in the sky?\\n\\n \\n\\nPrevious Lesson  There is no previous lesson.\\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\n\\n\\nWe analyze how the Sun aligned with human-made structures on a particular day of the year and develop an initial model to explain this phenomenon. We consider how the position of the sunset on Earth can connect our daily lives to the sky and then brainstorm other interesting patterns in the sky. We bring in stories from family or community members about patterns in the sky they have seen or heard about and how these might be connected to the rhythms of human life. We use a jigsaw strategy with a series of podcasts to learn about ways that humans across cultures and throughout time have relied on and made connections to the sky, and we identify additional patterns. We develop a model of the parts and changes in the parts of the system that are needed to explain many of the patterns we have identified. We develop questions for the Driving Question Board (DQB), and then brainstorm ideas for where to go next.\\n \\n\\nNext Lesson  We will gather information from videos about Native American stories and changes in the day and night over 6 months. We will add more questions to the DQB. We will use our new understanding to develop initial models to explain why one star does not appear to move in the night sky.\\n\\n \\n\\nBUILDING TOWARD NGSS\\n\\nMS-ESS1-1, MS-ESS1-2, MS-ESS1-3,\\nMS-PS2-4, MS-PS4-2\\n\\n \\n\\nWhat students will do\\n\\n1.A\\tAsk questions about systems in space that arise from observations of patterns in the sky.\\n\\n1.B\\tObtain information from images, videos, and podcasts to describe patterns in natural phenomena of objects in the Solar System (and beyond), as seen from Earth.\\n\\n1.C\\tDevelop an initial model of systems in space to describe patterns we observe in the sky.\\n\\nWhat students will figure out\\n\\n?\\tChanging patterns in the sky connect to our (daily) lives and set the rhythms for life on Earth.\\n?\\tStories and analogies related to the sky are legitimate ways to preserve knowledge about the stars and planets and aid in observing and decision making.\\n?\\tLight travels in a straight line; it must enter our eye in order for us to see the object it came from.\\n?\\tThe Earth rotates about its axis once every day and orbits the Sun once every year.\\n \\n?\\tIn order to better explain and understand a complex system, we may need to view/visualize it from multiple perspectives.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Learning Plan Snapshot\\nPart\\tDuration\\tSummary\\tSlide\\tMaterials\\n1\\t13 min\\tNOTICE AND WONDER ABOUT A NEW PHENOMENON\\nIntroduce a new phenomenon�the Sun aligning perfectly between buildings on a certain day at sunset.\\tA-C\\thttps://youtu.be/8b6yjyANrkQ, Manhattanhenge Notice and Wonder poster, Word Wall poster, markers\\n2\\t10 min\\tDEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL TO EXPLAIN MANHATTANHENGE\\nStudents create an initial model of what might be happening to cause Manhattanhenge and why we don�t see it every day.\\tD-E\\tInitial Manhattanhenge Model\\n3\\t10 min\\tSHARE OUT THE OBJECTS AND INTERACTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO SEE OR NOT SEE MANHATTANHENGE\\nThe class gathers initial ideas for possible objects and interactions that cause the Manhattanhenge phenomenon to happen.\\tF\\tParts & interactions in the system that help explain the Manhattanhenge Phenomenon poster, markers\\n4\\t8 min\\tCONNECT THIS PATTERN TO THE SKY\\nStudents brainstorm other patterns that they have experienced or heard about related to the sky.\\tG\\tsticky notes, Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster, markers\\n5\\t4 min\\tNAVIGATION AND HOME LEARNING\\nAsk students to bring in stories from family or community members about patterns or other phenomena in the sky they have seen or heard about.\\tH\\tCommunity Connections to the Sky\\nEnd of day 1\\n6\\t8 min\\tNAVIGATION AND RETURN TO HOME LEARNING\\nStudents share ideas they got from family and community members.\\tI-J\\tCommunity Connections to the Sky, sticky notes, Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster\\n7\\t20 min\\tPODCAST JIGSAW\\nUse a jigsaw strategy for podcasts to learn about ways that humans across cultures and throughout time have relied on and made connections to the sky.\\tK-L\\tMaking Sense of the Podcast Jigsaw,\\nReading- Podcast: Thebe Medupe - Rebirth of Selemela, Reading- Podcast: Annette Lee- As It Is Above, It Is Below, Reading- Podcast: Jessie Ferrari - Wombat Season, Reading- Podcast: Gerardo Aldana - The Descent of the Feathered Serpent, headphones, https://youtu.be/4CMekbYmQuU, https://youtu.be/6RgBl2wNHkw,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\thttps://youtu.be/vv5I4_rYTjg, https://youtu.be/X5Yt0Z7MOKU, Listening Group Roles Reference, audio player\\n8\\t14 min\\tMAKING SENSE OF PODCASTS AS A CLASS\\nFacilitate a Building Understandings Discussion to generate ideas about why studying the sky is relevant and about specific patterns in the sky.\\tM\\tMaking Sense of the Podcast Jigsaw, sticky notes\\n9\\t3 min\\tNAVIGATION AND EXIT TICKET\\nGive students a chance to reflect on the podcasts before we begin modeling the next time we are together.\\tN\\tblank piece of paper\\nEnd of day 2\\n10\\t9 min\\tMODEL PATTERNS OR PHENOMENA IN THE SKY INDIVIDUALLY\\nStudents choose a pattern to model on their own\\tO-P\\tMy Initial Model to Explain: \\t, Systems Modeling Scaffold (optional), Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster\\n11\\t6 min\\tCOMPARE INITIAL MODELS\\nStudents share their model with a partner and make revisions.\\tQ\\tMy Initial Model to Explain: \\t, Systems Modeling Scaffold (optional), Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster\\n12\\t25 min\\tBUILD A CONSENSUS MODEL OF SYSTEMS IN SPACE\\nConduct a gallery walk.

Do not post this word on the wall until after your class has developed a shared understanding of its meaning.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nIn this lesson, students begin with a phenomenon that is directly connected to their experience but with a twist: a sunset that aligns with human-made structures on a certain day but not other days. But we quickly expand away from this phenomenon to think about other patterns in the sky. By the time students develop models on Day 3, they should be thinking about any and all patterns in the sky that they think might be connected to systems in space and their lives or the lives/histories of other people on our planet. In Lessons 2�7, students will model and explain:\\n(a) seasonal patterns of the Sun�s path across the sky and the related phenomena of seasonal temperature changes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres; (b) changing patterns of constellations visible in the night sky across the year from different places on Earth; (c) the periodicity of lunar phases; (d) solar eclipses; and (e) predicting when solar eclipses would tend to occur. In addition, by employing the practice of modeling complex phenomena students will motivate the need to have multiple perspectives in order to make sense of the interactions between the objects in the system at multiple scales. When making the Ideas for Investigations poster and during investigations in later lessons, students will identify the need to not just mechanistically model on paper but also create two- and three-dimensional models to showcase these perspectives and interactions.\\n\\nBy drawing out a broader range of patterns in the sky during this anchoring phenomena routine, a greater number of student questions specific to this performance expectation bundle can be addressed through investigations throughout the unit. Furthermore, this broad anchor increases student engagement and leverages necessary student prior knowledge from the Physical and Earth and Space Sciences from the K�2 and 3�5 grade bands of the NRC Framework. It is necessary in this lesson to revisit briefly what students have figured out in previous grade bands.\\n\\nSee the unit front matter for more details on the prior knowledge students may be bringing into the classroom elementary DCI elements and how the initial models developed in this lesson will connect to future lessons.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nStudents may suggest sudden events like asteroid collisions or supernovae. The focus of this unit is explaining repeating patterns, so while there may be the opportunity to read about these events over the course of the unit, students will not be modeling or explaining them.\\n\\nStudents may also broaden their questions on the DQB to include things they have heard about in space, like black holes or supernovae. Stars and stellar evolution are high school grade band and are not covered in this unit. Put these questions up on the DQB now, but know that they may end up unanswered. Encourage interested students to research unanswered questions at the end of the unit.\\n\\nThe words patterns and perspective are introduced formally in this lesson but will likely have already been built out in other OpenSciEd units, but in different contexts. In future lessons, there will be more vocabulary to add to a Word Wall and/or personal glossary. But other than patterns and perspective, in this lesson, accept and build on students� everyday words, using scientific vocabulary like lunar or annual only if students are using these words fluently already. When coming to consensus on the meaning of Word Wall words, be sure to co-construct the meaning of each word with your students.\\n\\nIt is not until the fourth lesson set of the unit , that we will define, as a class, what we mean by the Solar System.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� NOTICE AND WONDER ABOUT A NEW PHENOMENON\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, https://youtu.be/8b6yjyANrkQ, Manhattanhenge Notice and Wonder poster, Word Wall poster, markers\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduce a new phenomenon. Present slide A. Launch the unit by sharing about a new phenomenon you encountered on the news. Depending on the time of year you teach the unit, adapt what you say to fit whether it already happened or is happening soon. Say, I was watching the news the other day and heard about thousands of people going to New York City on the same day to watch the sunset. Ask, have any of you heard of something like this? Take a show of hands.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nThis phenomenon and others that students explore in this unit are strictly visual and based on changes in color and light.\\nConsider the needs of your students and how you will make visual phenomena accessible to all of your students, including those with color blindness or low vision, those who are blind, and/or those with other visual impairments. Possible modifications include providing a tactile representation of the changes being investigated, alternate color schemes, increasing the size and/or brightness of images provided digitally, and using descriptive alt text. Work with your students� IEP or 504 caseworker to support your students� needs.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Allowing students to express their ideas using multiple modalities supports student ownership of their learning by giving students choice, access, and control in navigating their own understanding around the science ideas.\\nKeeping a science notebook allows students a space in which to reflect and communicate their developing understandings about science ideas and to track changes in their\\n \\nWatch a video of Manhattanhenge. Present slide B. Have students make a Notice and Wonder T-chart for Manhattanhenge in their science notebook.

You might want to play the video clip more than once.?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare out noticings and patterns we noticed. Show slide C. Have students go public with any patterns they noticed or important noticings during Manhattanhenge. Record students� responses on the Manhattanhenge Notice and Wonder poster.\\n \\nunderstandings. Students should be encouraged to record their ideas using linguistic (e.g., written words) and nonlinguistic (e.g., photographs, drawings, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, measurements) modes. This is especially important for emerging multilingual students because making connections between written words and nonlinguistic representations helps students generate richer explanations of scientific phenomena.\\n\\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING PATTERNS\\n\\nMake sure when you are defining a pattern you do it in the language of your class, a pattern is a repeated instance. This is something that students should have coming in (from prior grade bands and OpenSciEd units), but because we are thinking on such different scales of time and size, it is important to make sure students acknowledge what these words mean, especially if there are students new to the class and/or new to English.\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� DEVELOP AN INITIAL MODEL TO EXPLAIN MANHATTANHENGE\\t10 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Manhattanhenge Model\\n\\nOrient to the model scaffold as a class. Display slide D. Spend three minutes explaining using both maps as a model scaffold. Distribute a copy of Initial Manhattanhenge Model to each student. Don�t have students put this handout in their notebooks yet. You will be collecting them at the end of the period. Decide whether you will put the handout Initial Manhattanhenge Model or if you will use the images on slide D.\\n\\nSay, You are going to use this handout to develop a model to show what interactions are happening with the objects in the system to cause the Manhattenge to happen on certain days but not others. Standing at the corner of 34th Street and 5th Avenue and facing northwest is where people say you can get some of the best views of the Manhattanhenge phenomenon. There are two maps of New York City, both showing this location. If you look at the photograph of Manhattanhenge, can you see the Empire State Building? Now try and find the Empire State Building on your maps. When looking northwest (toward the water) on May 31st at 8:17 p.m., this is what the photographer saw.\\n\\nIndividually develop an initial model to explain Manhattanhenge. Display slide E. Give students 5 minutes to complete Initial Manhattanhenge Model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollect Initial Manhattanhenge Model before the end of the class for a formative assessment.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n3\\t� SHARE OUT THE OBJECTS AND INTERACTIONS THAT CAUSE US TO SEE OR NOT SEE MANHATTANHENGE\\n \\n\\n10 min\\n \\n\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING CAUSE AND EFFECT\\n\\nIf your students have completed OpenSciEd Unit 8.3: How can a magnet move another object without touching it? (Magnets Unit), explicitly make the connection here between cause-and-effect relationships and patterns. Consider engaging students in\\n \\nmaking these connections by asking, How does cause and effect relate to patterns? How could you use the cause-and-effect sentence frames that we used to explore the speaker to talk about patterns in the sky? Students might suggest (or you might introduce) a modified sentence frame such as this: When something in space changes, we will observe this pattern. Review the unit front matter for an overview of how to scaffold crosscutting concepts in this unit.\\n\\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SCALE, PROPORTION, AND QUANTITY\\n\\nThe crosscutting concept of Scale, Proportion, and Quantity is central to this unit and to understanding space systems. Because our perspective on Earth is limited, phenomena that can be observed at one scale�for example by simulating the whole Solar System at once from a perspective above the system�may not be observable from our perspective. Many of the familiar patterns and phenomena we see on Earth are symptoms of this limitation of perspective and our inability to observe the system at scale. It is not until the fourth lesson set of the unit , that we will define, as a class, what we mean by the Solar System.\\n\\nReview the unit front matter for an overview of how to scaffold crosscutting concepts in this unit.\\n \\n\\n \\nIf the Sun sets on both days in our models, what is happening between the Sun and our eyes that allows us to see Manhattanhenge on one day but not the next?\\n \\nThe light (or light rays) are blocked by buildings on one day at sunset but not another.\\n \\nHow did you show an unblocked path of light coming to our eyes in one case but not another?\\n \\n\\n \\nHow did you draw the light rays in your models? If your students have had OpenSciEd Unit 6.1: Why do we sometimes see different things when looking at the same object?

But where exactly do we put the Sun in a model at this scale? What might be some challenges or limitations with representing the Sun in a model at this scale?. I heard you say light rays, but what is the source of those light rays? Where would you put the Sun in our model so that it appears to fit between the buildings, close to the people seeing Manhattanhenge?\\n \\nYes, we need to put the Sun way far away out in space and we need to show it between the buildings.\\n\\nIs there a way to include two places and sizes in our model?\\n\\nAccept all answers.\\n \\nThat is an interesting question for us to start considering, and we don�t need to resolve it yet. It has already helped us consider what scale and perspective we use in a model is most useful. Since we all agree the Sun Is a part in the system that causes this phenomenon, let�s keep track of that for now.?\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTake a moment to generalize out to broader phenomena and elicit student knowledge from earlier grades.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWe know that Manhattanhenge doesn�t happen every day, but the Sun still sets even if it isn�t between the buildings. What is the same and what is different or changing about the parts of the system when we don�t see the henge?\\n \\nThe Sun would still set on the horizon each day; it just wouldn�t be between the buildings.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat do you think is happening with the objects in the system to cause the Sun to set every day?Or\\nWhat is going on with the Earth each day for a sunset to happen in the first place?\\n \\nThe Earth is turning.\\n \\n\\n \\nCan someone show me with their hands what \\tmeans when they say the Earth is turning?\\n \\n(Watch for a spin of the Earth around itself.)\\n \\n\\n \\nAre there any other interactions in the system with other objects/parts that we should take into account in order to explain changes happening over something like a month? What else is changing over that period of time?\\n \\nWe learned in 5th grade that the Earth goes around the Sun each year.\\n\\nThe Earth would orbit part of the way around the Sun in a month.\\n \\n\\n \\nCan someone show me with their hands what \\tmeans when they say the Earth goes around the Sun?\\n \\n(Watch for an orbit of one object [Earth] around another [Sun].)\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n4\\t� CONNECT THIS PATTERN TO THE SKY\\t8 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Generating related phenomena is a key element of the Anchoring Phenomenon routine.

Listen for students to list observable phenomena connected to not only the motion of objects in the sky/space but also the appearance. Objects may include the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets. Some students may be suggesting comets and galaxies, while other students might suggest that the Sun goes around the Earth.\\n\\nWhat to do: Accept all ideas. If your students need support with foundational understandings (from earlier grade bands) about the motion of objects, make sure to take note in this lesson and then pause and establish these ideas when we model the Sun�Earth system in Lessons 2�4. If your students are eager to know more about other ideas, such as black holes or exoplanets, there are a number of optional readings and podcasts throughout this unit to connect students to myriad space-related phenomena.\\n\\nAs students are sharing their patterns and phenomena, push them to explain the phenomenon and connect it to something observable. If they struggle to do this, ask them, What are the objects connected to the pattern/phenomenon? What would we be able to see happening? Then give students time to respond to this feedback and create more sticky notes or revise what they wrote on their sticky note already with more detail, objects, observations, or connections.\\n \\nunderstanding around the science ideas. During moments when students are tasked with expressing their ideas, allow them to do so through linguistic (oral and written language) and nonlinguistic (e.g., drawings, graphs, symbols, gestures) modes. For example, you might suggest sketching a picture on the sticky note to a student who is having trouble articulating a pattern they have observed related to the Moon.\\nProviding students, emerging multilingual students in particular, with such opportunities allows them to use all their resources to express meaning.\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n5\\t� NAVIGATION AND HOME LEARNING\\t4 min\\nMATERIALS: Community Connections to the Sky\\n\\n \\nAssign home learning. Present slide H. Say, We have seen a lot of stuff in the sky and have a lot of ideas about what is going on to cause some of those patterns/phenomena. We will come back to this tomorrow but let�s see if we can get more ideas first. Our friends and family may have seen things or heard about things that we haven�t experienced. There might be stories our family or community know about things in the sky that go back even longer in time. Let�s pull in those resources.?\\n\\nDistribute Community Connections to the Sky. Say, Tonight, go home and poll your friends and family members. First, share with them what we have been talking about and share an example of a pattern, such as Manhattanhenge. Let them know that this is not about weather but about patterns we think are connected to space. Then ask them these questions:\\n1.\\tWhat patterns or phenomena have they seen in the sky?\\n2.\\tWhat stories have they heard from their family and community about patterns others have observed in the sky or about things on Earth that are connected to patterns and objects in the sky?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Framing students� families and communities as legitimate funds of knowledge can serve multiple purposes for student engagement. It can: (1) help students feel like they belong in the science classroom by situating their family and community knowledge as productive resources for science; (2) engage students� families in conversations about what is happening in the classroom; and (3) help students make connections between the science classroom and their everyday lives.\\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n\\n6\\t� NAVIGATION AND RETURN TO HOME LEARNING\\t8 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emerging multilingual students:\\nAllow and encourage students to speak using\\n \\nboth content-specific and everyday words and phrases when expressing their ideas. This helps students fully express themselves, allowing others to question, evaluate, and build off their ideas.

Present slide K. Introduce the podcasts and the close listening protocol using the slide. Say, Today we are going to listen to a podcast that was recorded by present-day scientists about their scientific research and the cultural identities of their people or the communities they study and work with. Each of these podcasts highlights a community from a different region on Earth. We will use a close listening protocol to help us obtain information through our noticings, gather our wonderings, and then make connections to not only the phenomena discussed in each podcast but also the community represented and our own connection to space and the sky.??\\n\\nWalk through the close listening protocol below and field any questions students have. Depending on how much time you have, warn students to keep pauses short.\\n\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nWhenever we consider cultural identity in the classroom, it is important to avoid framing this identity as static and homogenous and instead to recognize all people as having multilayered and multicultural identities. The podcast interviewees are not only celestial storytellers but also present-day research scientists, historians, and artists. The interviewee in Reading- Podcast: Jessie Ferrari\\n- Wombat Season shares their trans and gender fluid identity�this can send a powerful message that anyone can be a scientist, and the sharing of identities makes scientific discourse richer. It is easy to\\n \\ntokenize cultural stories. The goal is to respect but not oversimplify differences in the podcasts, classroom, and world.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOrganize students into small groups of 4�5 and assign them one of the following podcast links. Make sure that you distribute to each group the appropriate handout with the podcast transcript and accompanying images. If your class is larger than 25, you can choose to assign two groups to a podcast or increase the group size, depending on the number of audio players you have available. The podcasts are designed to be comprehensible by a range of 8th grade students. You may want to assign specific podcasts to specific students or allow students to choose what text they read.? Distribute Reading- Podcast: Thebe Medupe - Rebirth of Selemela, Reading- Podcast: Gerardo Aldana - The Descent of the Feathered Serpent, Reading- Podcast: Jessie Ferrari - Wombat Season , or Reading- Podcast: Annette Lee- As It Is Above, It Is Below (printed for students so they can mark up the text) to each student, or alternately, direct students to the corresponding podcast in their Student Edition book to view the images in color.

You may want to also talk about where your classroom would be on the globe. Providing physical objects and spatial models to convey perspective can help support representation, according to the UDL framework.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Providing students the opportunity to choose the level of perceived challenge can support engagement, help develop\\nself-determination and pride in accomplishment, and increase the degree to which they feel connected to their learning.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Reading the transcript of the podcast as they are listening to it provides students multiple representations (audio with closed captioning, photos, and text) of the information, which could be harder to interpret from audio alone. Consider posting a digital copy of the podcast and transcript for students who are\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nConsider assigning students roles to keep every student on task and enforce the use of the close listening protocol. We suggest the following roles for a group of 5, also found on Listening Group Roles Reference:\\n?\\tProgress monitor. This person periodically asks others to take the measure of the group�s progress. This includes watching the time to keep the group on track. Some questions the progress monitor might ask are the following:\\n?\\t�What can we say we�ve accomplished so far?�\\n?\\t�What do we still need to know or do to accomplish this task?�\\n?\\t�We have \\tminutes left. What can we do in that time to accomplish our task?�\\n?\\tBig ideas person. The role of this student is to relate the podcast to the question we are trying to answer.\\n?\\t�How does what you said relate to \\t?�\\n?\\t�How does this change the way we�re thinking about \\t?�\\n?\\tClarifier. This is a role of monitoring everyone�s comprehension about one or two key science terms. The clarifier might ask questions such as these:\\n?\\t�Do we know what the word \\trefers to?�\\n?\\t�Can we put it into our own words?�\\n?\\tQuestioner. This person asks probing questions during the activity. The questioner listens for questions posed by other group members and then revoices the questions to make sure that the whole group takes a moment to hear and entertain questions from everyone. This is not a role that students find easy, so it helps to provide them with question stems such as these:\\n?\\t�What does it mean that \\t?�\\n?\\t�How do we know that \\t?�\\n?\\t�So, what I think you are saying is \\t. Is that right?�\\n?\\tConductor. This role might not exist in a group of 4. This person monitors airtime of people in the group. The conductor is allowed to control who has �the floor� with the goal of ensuring that everyone gets a chance to talk and that everyone takes time to listen. The conductor will also be in charge of playing/pausing the podcast when requested.\\nIf you choose to assign roles, use Listening Group Roles Reference to help students understand their roles in the group.\\n\\nListen to the podcasts.? Pass out Making Sense of the Podcast Jigsaw and/or display slide L and have students work on the questions in their small, expert groups after they listen to the podcasts. Students can respond to these questions in their notebooks, on the handout, or as part of a verbal discussion:\\n \\ninterested in listening to it again outside of class and encourage them to share both the transcript and podcast with others in their family. Some students may find a variety of ways it is relevant to themselves and to others in their community. Examples include the stories of what drew these people into their careers, international connections, a diverse group of scientists, and/or thinking about their community connections to the sky, and in one�s own local area, over many years.\\n \\n1.\\tHow did the people you learned about: 1) observe the sky and keep track of what they saw?, and 2) use their observations of the sky?\\n2.\\tWhat patterns in the sky did you hear about in the podcast?

Listen for students to refer to the phenomena from each podcast:\\n\\n?\\tJess: when wombat season is and how what you see in the sky is connected to what you experience on Earth\\n?\\tThebe: viewing Selemela and the Southern Cross or the giraffe stars and making connections to people all over the world who have been collecting knowledge about the sky and testing their ideas to transmit information to the next generation\\n?\\tGerado: how using Sun and Moon based calendars allowed for rituals and gatherings to occur and mark the years\\n?\\tAnnette: how the Loon is visible all year round but the Great Panther constellation is not.\\n\\nWhat to do: If students struggle to find the information they need in the reading, call attention to the strategies and prompts in Reading: The Body�s Nervous System.? Remind them to use the before, during, and after reading strategies from the close listening protocol on slide k. If students are struggling with listening to the podcast, allow students to read their assigned transcript with a partner.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n9\\t� NAVIGATION AND EXIT TICKET\\t3 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n10\\t� MODEL PATTERNS OR PHENOMENA IN THE SKY INDIVIDUALLY\\t9 min\\nMATERIALS: My Initial Model to Explain: \\t, Systems Modeling Scaffold (optional), Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster\\n\\n \\nOrient students to where we have been and where we are going. Organize students into groups of 2�3 to prepare for this activity. Larger groups will increase the time you will need to spend. Display slide O. Point to the Patterns and Phenomena in the Sky poster. Say, Wow, we have a lot of patterns and phenomena we are interested in. Choose a pattern or phenomenon that you want to explain today and share the pattern or phenomenon you chose with a partner.\\n\\nGive students a minute to do this and then say, On Day 1 of this lesson, when we were talking about Manhattanhenge, we ended up identifying important parts and interactions we would need to include in a model to explain why we can see that phenomenon only on certain days of the year. We also realized when we were thinking about where to put the Sun on our map that it might make more sense to change where we are at when we look at the system in order to fully explain what is happening.\\n\\nFirst, consider the parts of the system for each phenomenon. Say, Let�s use that sort of thinking going forward. Consider first what parts and interactions you think you are going to need to include in your system diagram of the phenomenon or pattern you choose. Feel free to refer to the ones we outlined here for the Manhattanhenge phenomenon to decide which, if any, of these are also needed as well as what other parts or interactions you might also need to add. Tell your group what parts you think will need to be in the system you model to help explain your pattern. Give students two minutes for this.\\n\\nModel the system individually and then present to small groups. Display slide P. Review the directions on the slide. Emphasize that the shift in perspective called for on the handout is a way to get us to show the system from a different viewpoint, which can be a different angle and/or at a different scale. Add a similar co-constructed class definition to the Word Wall for change in perspective: A change in the scale or angle at which we are viewing some parts or all of parts of the system.??\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN DEVELOPING AND USING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM MODELS\\n\\nIf needed, you could scaffold the idea of perspective further, by asking students to imagine what the Goldberg system might look like from another point of view, for example, that of the bird or that of the man. Consider using Systems Modeling Scaffold to lead a supplemental activity and discussion about this.\\n\\nNote that the words parts and components are used interchangeably in the NGSS and in OpenSciEd. Using both words can be confusing for students, particularly emergent multilinguals, so be explicit when you use a synonym. Now might be a nice time to remind students that parts and components are different ways to refer to the things in a\\n \\nsystem that work together, but they can be used interchangeably.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emerging multilinguals: Provide opportunities for emerging multilingual students to break down the meaning of scientific words that are central to the lesson, such as perspective. Perspective might mean one thing to students in everyday talk that is slightly different from how we are using it here. Highlighting how words can have different meanings in different contexts can provide emerging multilingual students the chance and space in which to discuss any preconceptions about the meaning of the word(s) and to draw upon their personal experiences.\\n\\n11\\t� COMPARE INITIAL MODELS\\t6 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� BUILD A CONSENSUS MODEL OF SYSTEMS IN SPACE\\t25 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Use classroom norms to support engagement by fostering an equitable learning community that promotes trusting and caring\\n \\n\\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\n\\nBuilding towards: 1.C Develop an initial model of systems in space to describe patterns we observe in the sky.\\n\\nWhat to look/listen for: Look for students who are including parts or interactions in their system that might not be necessary to explain the pattern they chose. For example, a student might have chosen to model seasons but included all eight classical planets in orbit around the Sun in their model.\\n\\nIn addition, look for students who are representing scale in their models by indicating �zooming� of perspectives. This is a sophisticated way to represent scale and will become part of our consensus model later in the unit. Make note of these models to highlight in Lesson Set 4.\\n\\nWhat to do: If students need support choosing what to put in their models, begin the Scientists Circle with a review of bounding systems. If most students are not modeling interactions, push students to think more about them (i.e., forces, sunlight, movement) among the parts as the class develops a consensus model. Make note of students who are representing interactions between parts and bring attention to their representations as the class builds their initial models.\\n \\nrelationships. The norms should reinforce to students the value of: (1) the diversity of thought among all classroom community members in pushing our learning forward; and (2) providing a safe learning environment that ensures fair participation. In addition, classroom norms should interrupt cultural norms or stereotypes that could make science experiences feel uncomfortable for some students (e.g., as being someone who is not intelligent enough to think like a scientist, who cannot do the relevant math, who cannot share their thinking).\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\n \\nRevisit classroom norms. Take this opportunity to remind the class how we listen to one another, press on one another�s ideas, and ask questions of one another and that it�s OK to disagree with ideas but it�s important to be respectful. You can use slide S to remind students of the classroom norms (if you have developed your own set of norms, replace this slide with your norms).?\\n\\nRemind students of the Communicating in Scientific Ways sentence starters.? Make certain a Communicating in Scientific Ways poster or handout is visible. Emphasize that each individual has contributions to make to their community of learners. Ask them which sentence starters they might want to use to help them talk to one another. Examples include these:\\n\\nThink of an idea, claim, prediction, or model to explain your data and observations:\\n?\\tMy idea is �.\\n?\\tI think that �.\\n?\\tWe could draw it this way � to show .... Give evidence for your idea or claim:\\n?\\tMy evidence is �.\\n?\\tThe reason I think that this evidence supports this is �.\\n\\nOther examples could come from: (1) listening to others� ideas and asking clarifying questions, (2) agreeing or disagreeing with others� ideas, and (3) adding to others� ideas.\\n \\nSupporting emerging multilingual students: Scaffolds such as sentence starters can model and facilitate particular oral or written language production skills, such as formulating questions, hypotheses, explanations, or arguments based on evidence (see Communicating in Scientific Ways poster). Such scaffolds may be of particular benefit for emerging multilingual students to help them develop language skills to write or communicate their ideas to peers. It is important that scaffolds be used purposefully and removed when no longer needed.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Use representations like color coding and/or letter or number coding to foreground parts of the model. Create a key to track what colors,\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nUse slide T to remind students that the goal of this Consensus Discussion is to determine areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models to help us decide how to proceed in figuring out these patterns in the sky.\\n \\nsymbols, or letter or number codes represent different parts of the system. While color coding is a useful way to quickly reference the parts of the model, letter or number coding helps ensure accessibility for any student who may be color blind. If color coding is used, consider a color palette that uses orange, blue, black, or dark brown.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nAsk each of the questions on slide T (and in Initial Models Gallery Walk).\\n?\\tWhat similarities did you see among parts of the systems? What about differences?\\n?\\tWhat similarities did you see among the motions and interactions of objects? What about differences?\\n?\\tWhat similarities did you see among perspectives? What about differences?\\n\\nConsider using a round-robin format to give every student a chance to either share something they wrote or comment respectfully on something someone else has shared. As students share out, use their ideas to draw an Initial Consensus Model for Explaining all of our different Phenomena and Patterns at the front of the room, as in the following descriptions and images.?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� NAVIGATION AND STOP AND JOT\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: It is important to organize activities in ways that\\n \\ncreate opportunities to support student engagement in meaningful, accountable talk by emphasizing socially safe activity structures (e.g., small-group or partner work before a whole-class discussion). As students learn to go public with their ideas, it can help to give them time to think quietly and individually before having to go public with their questions in a small or large group. Do not bother to collect these Stop and Jots, but instead ask students to hold onto them to inform them of their work in the next class meeting.\\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n\\n14\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD (DQB)\\t27 min\\n\\n \\n?\\tWhy does the sky change into different colors while the Sun is setting?\\n?\\tWhy are stars more visible at nighttime?\\n?\\tHow far away are stars from Earth?\\n?\\tWhy do planets look bright when we see them at night?\\n?\\tWhy does the Moon turn red?\\n?\\tWhy does the Sun last longer in the summer than in the winter?\\n?\\tWhy does the Moon change shape?\\n?\\tDo the stars orbit just like the Earth and Moon?\\n?\\tHow did people look at the stars and see figures?

Instruct students to bring their sticky notes with completed questions along with their science notebooks to meet in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. The Initial Consensus Model poster and Phenomena and Patterns in Space poster should be visible.\\n\\n \\nRemind students how to create the DQB (use slide X if needed):\\n?\\tThe first student reads their question aloud to the class then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tStudents who are listening should raise their hand if one of their questions relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads their question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThat student selects the next student, who may have a related question or a new question.\\n?\\tWe will continue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n\\nOrganize questions into categories. As students share, questions will naturally cluster into similar areas, such as questions about the Sun and questions about the Moon. Once students have finished their sharing, ask students to look at the questions for any additional\\norganization that can be done. Use larger stickies to label these clusters. Some clusters that may emerge include: �Stars,� �Moon,� �Sun,� �Planets,� and �Other.�\\n\\n\\nDevelop an initial driving question. Say, Now that we have written our questions, what question should we put at the top of our DQB?\\n\\nLook for students to suggest something like these examples:\\n?\\tHow are we connected to space through patterns in the sky?\\n?\\tWhy do we see patterns in the way things look in the sky?\\n?\\tHow do things in space create the patterns we see in the sky?\\n\\nPush students to suggest questions that address:\\n?\\tpatterns (or phenomena or things that happen),\\n?\\tour experience of those patterns (our connection, that we see them), and\\n?\\tperhaps even causal mechanisms for those patterns (why do they happen? why do we see them?).\\n\\nFeel free to suggest tweaks to students� wording or combine multiple questions. For example, if one student suggests, �Why are there patterns in the sky?� and another student suggests, �What does the Solar System look like?� you can say, I heard one person asking about patterns and one person asking about systems in space. Can someone combine these into a single question? Once an idea is on the table that\\n \\nmeets the criteria and/or looks like one of the previous examples, revoice this question. Then ask, Does everyone agree on this for our initial driving question? Once the class agrees, add the question to the top of the DQB.\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.A Ask questions about systems in space that arise from observations of patterns in the sky.\\n\\nWhat to look/listen for: As the class builds the Driving Question Board (DQB), listen for: (1) the subsystems, patterns, and changes in objects that students are asking questions about; and (2) how the questions relate to patterns and systems. Possible systems/subsystems could include the Earth�Sun, Earth�Moon,\\nEarth�Sun�Moon, the Solar System, color changes of objects such as planets/moons/suns/stars/galaxies, shape changes (or eclipses/transits) of solar system objects, orbits, comets, etc.\\n\\nWhat to do: It is important that all questions posed by students be placed on the DQB regardless of whether they are open-ended or close-ended. As students ask questions, have them reflect on any patterns that have few or no questions posted on the DQB. Prompt students to generate more questions in this space so that we are motivated to investigate several subsystems of the Solar System. If students are struggling to come up with questions, have them look back through their science notebook, at the posters created during this lesson, at the podcasts, and at the stories from their community. Ask, what personal experience have you had viewing objects and their patterns in the sky? What was interesting or confusing about what you saw, and why you were able to see it? Give students time to go back and revise their sticky notes or create new sticky notes. If you notice this is occurring for several students, have them come together in a Turn and Talk, share their questions (or parts of questions) with their partners, and follow which objects or part of the system their question comes from.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n15\\t� BRAINSTORM NEXT STEPS\\t13 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� NAVIGATION AND OPTIONAL HOME LEARNING\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: Lesson 1 Community Guide for Looking at the Sky\\n\\nConsider where to go next. Present slide Z and say, We had the idea of actually going outside and observing these patterns in the sky and also gathering more stories of connections to the sky from communities all over the world. Let�s do that, whenever we can! How can we gather these stories and patterns from observations in our own communities and from other cultures or places?\\n\\nListen for students to suggest some of the following ideas; if they�re not already on your class list of ideas for investigations and data we need, you can add them now.\\n?\\tgoing outside and looking at the sky with members of our community,\\n?\\tlistening to people from around the world\\n?\\twatching videos of phenomena/patterns in the sky from other communities\\n\\nSay, That sounds great! I encourage you to safely begin noticing what they see in the sky, keeping notes, and collecting stories from their communities. Distribute the Lesson 1 Community Guide for Looking at the Sky as a tool to support students in talking with other people they trust to begin making observations of changing patterns in the sky.\\n\\nAsk, What objects in the sky should we start looking at? Listen for students to mention that we can see the sun almost every day. If students do not mention beginning by looking at patterns of the Sun, ask, If we are feeling stuck, what objects might we want to see first to explain the phenomena or patterns from Manhattanhenge or the podcasts?\\n\\n \\nSAFETY PRECAUTIONS\\n \\nIf you feel it is not safe or practical for students to be outside of their homes, especially at night, encourage students to look out a window or have them do the activity at school. Also, make sure to reiterate with your students to never stare directly at the Sun because it can be permanently damaging to their eyes.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nAdditional Lesson 1 Teacher Guidance\\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.8.1 Engage effectively in a range of collaborative discussions (one-on-one, in groups, and teacher-led) with diverse partners on grade 8 topics, texts, and issues, building on others\\' ideas and expressing their own clearly.\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.8.1.B Follow rules for collegial discussions and decision-making, track progress toward specific goals and deadlines, and define individual roles as needed.\\n\\nWhen students work in small groups to listen to podcasts, they each take different roles to help their group function productively. The roles suggested on Listening Group Roles Reference support students in sharing the cognitive load of analyzing and interpreting the podcasts rather than being simply procedural. The suggested questions and comments provided for each role support students as they become more independent in navigating group decision-making, coming to consensus, and tracking their progress on the task at hand.\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RST.6-8.2 Determine the central ideas or conclusions of a text; provide an accurate summary of the text distinct from prior knowledge or opinions.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: How do organisms get their differences?\\n\\n \\n\\nPrevious Lesson  There is no previous lesson.\\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n3 days\\n \\n\\n\\nWe observe a bull and other animals that have extra-big muscles. We develop initial models to explain what could be causing these animals to have such big muscles. We realize that muscles don�t come in just two sizes, large and small; We also observe photos of other organisms to identify variations in traits other than musculature. After generating a list of related phenomena of other organisms that are generally the same but have wide variations in some of their features, we develop a Driving Question Board and ideas for future investigations.\\n \\n\\nPasse-Partout\\n\\nNext Lesson We will observe images and video animations to figure out that muscles have specific cell and protein structures.

The teacher reference Unit-Wide Lesson-by-Lesson Model Resource is provided to help you anticipate the various updates and additions to this model.\\n\\nHave transparent tape available for students to attach the Initial Model handout to their science notebook.\\n\\nGather the cattle photo cards and tulip photo cards from your materials kit. Or, if you do not have premade cards from the materials kit, prepare them as follows:\\n?\\tPrint 1 color copy on cardstock of Cattle Photo Cards and cut the cards apart to make 1 set of 30 individual photos.\\n?\\tPrint 8 color copies on cardstock of Tulip Photo Cards and cut and organize the cards to make 8 sets of 24 photos per set. The images are numbered in each set, so each set will need tulips #1-24.\\n \\n?\\tConsider laminating both the cattle and tulip cards since you will reuse them for each class you teach and can keep them year to year.\\n?\\tYou will distribute the cattle cards individually to students, but groups of students will each get an entire set of tulip cards, so consider bundling those with rubber bands or binder clips so they�re easier to distribute.\\n\\nNote that we included names for the cattle used in this lesson and others for easy reference; some of these are simplified versions of the animals� actual names, but many were invented because the actual name was not available.\\n\\nHave half-sheets of copy paper ready to add the following words to the Word Wall: trait, variation. Do not post these words on the wall until after your class has developed a shared understanding of their meaning.\\n\\nAs a reminder about supporting students with visual disabilities: This unit in general and this lesson specifically use images as data. So, you will need to make accommodations so that students with visual disabilities can access these data. Depending on your students� needs, suggested modifications include enlarging and/or brightening the provided digital versions of these photos or using alternate text descriptions. Your students� IEP or 504 case leaders should also be able to provide you with specific resources and possible modifications to use.\\n\\nIf you have students who are color blind, the conversations in this lesson around color variations in a group of organisms may pose a unique challenge. If you haven�t already done so, take some time to talk with your student(s), familiarizing yourself with their way(s) of seeing the world, and ask how you can best support them as they investigate differences among organisms, including but not limited to their color patterns.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nStudents may come into this unit with different ideas about how animals get such big muscles. They most likely will know that diet and exercise play a large role in how big an animal�s muscles get. What they might not know is that the extra-big muscles they see in the anchoring phenomenon are the result of having an allele for the MSTN gene that makes a different shape of a protein called myostatin. Figuring out the genetic and environmental factors that can influence musculature is the focus of the first lesson set of the unit; in the second lesson set, students will explore how genetic and environmental factors influence the variation we see in other traits in other organisms.\\n\\nThis unit intentionally brings out the effects of environmental factors on trait variation because this is an important scientific concept to understand that will be further built upon in high school. The trait variation we see among living things is almost never due to genetics alone. By the end of the unit, students will grasp that genes and environment are always at play in the variation we see among living things. (There is a gene and environment interaction, but this is beyond the middle school grade-band understanding).\\n\\nNote that we generally refer to this phenomenon as �extra-big muscles� until Lesson 4, when we hear a farmer describe these cattle as �heavily muscled.�\\n\\nThe teacher reference Unit-Wide Lesson-by-Lesson Model Resource is provided in Lesson 1 to help you see the scope of what students will figure out in the entire unit.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nThere is no immediate need for students to connect the variation we see in animals� musculature as the result of inheritance (although they might, and that�s fine, too). In fact, the next couple of lessons explore exactly what the students might predict causes these differences: environmental factors like diet and exercise. Students will realize in Lesson 4 that environmental factors alone cannot explain all the variation they see in the heavily muscled animals, which will be a natural turning point to a focus on inheritance. Therefore, it is not necessary to have questions about family or inheritance or genes on the DQB at this time.\\n\\nWe made a deliberate choice not to use the word �species� in this unit. Understanding this classification is beyond the scope of this unit, and the words �group� and �population� (in Lesson 4 and beyond) better fit the needs of our work in this unit.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� OBSERVE PHOTOS OF CATTLE WITH TYPICAL AND SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT MUSCULATURE\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Notice and Wonder chart, markers\\n\\nIntroduce an interesting phenomenon. Say, I�ve got some pictures of interesting animals to show you. When I first saw them, I found them very surprising. I want us to take a look at them as a class.\\n\\nSet up Notice and Wonder charts in science notebooks. Display slide A. Say, You�ll use your science notebooks to record what you notice and wonder about the animals shown in the pictures, so let�s set up a chart now so we are ready to record our thoughts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndependently record noticings and wonderings about the bull photos. Say, The photos I�m going to show you are of actual animals. These photos have not been altered to make them look like this. Take a couple of minutes to look at them carefully and record what you notice and wonder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisplay slide B. Give students about 2 minutes to work silently on the Notice and Wonder chart in their science notebook.\\n\\nTurn and talk about the bull photos. After students have had some time to work on their own, display slide C and direct them to share their thinking with a neighbor. Remind them to refer to specific details in the photos to support their ideas.\\n\\nShare noticings and wonderings with the whole group in an Initial Ideas Discussion. Display slide D and record students� thinking on a Notice and Wonder chart as they share.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nExample Notice and Wonder chart.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2\\t� MAKE OBSERVATIONS ABOUT OTHER ANIMALS THAT HAVE BIG MUSCLES\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook\\n\\nObserve other animals with extra-big muscles. Display slides E through J one at a time, allowing some time for students to notice and comment on the images. Keep this part moving, no more than 20 seconds per slide. No need for students to write down anything. The goal is to broaden out to more examples of animals that have really large muscles. The large musculature isn�t just a one-time thing that happened in one animal.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat do you notice?\\n \\nThere are so many different animals that have extra-big muscles!\\n\\nThe black-and-white cattle have different coloration than the pictures we originally saw, but they still have big differences in the muscles.\\n\\nThese animals with big muscles are all ones that humans interact with a lot, like on farms or as pets.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat are you wondering now about these animals?\\n \\nHow are these animals getting so jacked? Do they go work out at the gym?\\n\\nHow does this work?\\n\\nDoes this happen in the wild or just when humans are involved?\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n3\\t� CREATE INITIAL MODELS\\t15 min\\n\\n \\n? SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN ENGAGING IN DEVELOPING AND USING MODELS\\n\\nRemind students that we are using this model to predict and describe what we think may be causing this phenomenon, so the goal of this initial model is to get students� thinking down on paper, not to have the �correct� answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\t� COMPARE AND CONTRAST INITIAL MODELS\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n5\\t� CONSENSUS MODEL DISCUSSION\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: Initial Model, chart paper, markers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBring students together in a Scientists Circle for a Consensus Discussion. Display slide N. Tell students that the goal of this discussion is to figure out areas of agreement and disagreement in our initial models. Knowing where we agree and disagree will help us figure out how we might want to proceed in figuring out how these animals got their different muscles.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRepresent areas of agreement and disagreement in a classroom consensus model. It is unlikely that you will have complete consensus about the possible causes of these muscle differences. Instead, students will likely propose a handful of causes that everyone can probably agree are worth investigating. Mark areas of disagreement or ideas to pursue with question marks. It is OK (preferred, even) to have several possible causes to investigate later.\\n\\nThroughout the discussion, and again toward the end, remind students to record any questions they have right now in their science notebook so we do not lose those questions.\\n \\n6\\t� OBSERVE MORE PHOTOS SHOWING OTHER VARIATIONS\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: Cattle Photo Cards, Tulip Photo Cards, half-sheets of copy paper, markers\\n\\nSuggest a question about our classroom consensus model. Display slide O.\\n\\nSay, We developed a classroom consensus model to explain the differences between individuals with extra-big versus typical muscles, but as we have been talking about this, I have been thinking. Are there only two sizes of muscles that animals can have--extra big and typical--or do you think that there can be other sizes of muscles too? Turn and talk with a neighbor. Share what you think and decide if you agree with each other�s ideas or not and explain why.\\n\\nGive students a minute to turn and talk with a partner.\\n\\n\\nSay, I have some photographs of different cattle that we can use to try to find additional evidence to support or refute the initial arguments you shared with your partners.\\n\\nObserve and compare other cattle photos. Display slide P. Distribute all 30 individual images of cattle from the Cattle Photo Cards--depending on how many students are in your class, each student may get 1 or 2 photos or share a photo with a partner. Direct students to compare the muscles of their animal to others in the class, inviting students to stand up and cluster together or form a loose line of cattle photos based on how muscled the cattle appear to be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk, What do you notice about the muscles of these cattle?\\n\\nSample student responses\\n?\\tThe cattle have different amounts of muscles.\\n?\\tThere probably are not just two groups (extra-muscled or typical).\\n\\nSay, We focused specifically on the muscles of these cattle just now, but look at your photo and the ones around you: What other characteristics do these cattle have that we could sort or organize them by?\\n\\nEach time a student suggests a characteristic, ask, How could we group or arrange them if we focused on that characteristic?\\n \\n\\nSample student responses\\n?\\thorns (none, small, bigger, really long)\\n?\\tcolor (black, white, brown, reddish)\\n?\\tpattern (solid color, big spots, small spots)\\n?\\tfur texture (smooth, short, shaggy, long)\\n\\nDefine trait and variation. Point out to students that scientists have specific words to use when describing the differences we�ve been talking about.\\n\\nSay, It can get tricky to talk about these differences, so we�re going to add a few terms to our science Word Wall to help us have discussions about this. You pointed out some of the general characteristics or features that cattle have, such as color or height or horns--these are called �traits�. The differences within each of those categories--such as black, white, brown, or reddish for color and none, small, bigger, and really long for horns--these are the variations within the trait. So the trait includes all the variations in that category.\\nAdd trait and variation to your Word Wall. Sample definitions are shown here.\\n\\nSuggest exploring differences in other organisms, too. Ask, If we looked at other living things, do you think we would see other variations in their traits, too?\\n\\nWork in small groups to observe photos of tulips and identify traits and variations. Display slide Q. Say, I have some images of a type of flower called a tulip. Work with your group to observe the images and identify some traits of tulips. Choose one trait and then organize the images by variations in that trait, grouping them or lining them up to show the variations.\\n\\nForm 8 small groups of students and distribute a set of 24 images from Tulip Photo Cards to each group. Give students 5-7 minutes to examine their photos and sort them based on a trait of their choice. If they have time to spare, encourage groups to reorganize their tulip photos based on a different trait.\\n\\nDebrief findings from these observations. Gather students together in a whole group again and display slide R. Have students briefly share examples of the traits and their variations. Traits students may identify (with possible variations they may sort by)\\n?\\tcolor (white, yellow, orange, red, purple)\\n?\\tcolor pattern (solid, center stripe, edge outline, speckled)\\n?\\tpetal shape (rounded, pointed, narrow, wide)\\n?\\tpetal edge texture (smooth, fringed, ruffled)\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� LIST RELATED PHENOMENA\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n8\\t� ASSIGN HOME LEARNING (OPTIONAL)\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nAt some point during this unit, your students may bring up the idea that they may (or may not) share traits with members of their families. Recall that not all your students may be living with or in touch with their biological family members and therefore would not be able to compare themselves with their parents, grandparents, siblings,\\n \\n\\nHOME LEARNING OPPORTUNITY\\n \\n\\nHelp support students and trusted members of their community in observing variations in living things. Encourage students to bring their observations and ideas back to class to inform and enrich the work of this unit. Inviting students to bring their family and/or community knowledge, experiences, and practices into school not only supports students in coordinating the learning they do outside school with what they do in school, but it can also help you as a teacher to expand your understanding of the strengths of the families and communities you work with.\\n \\nand so on. In order to be sensitive to these situations, you should not direct students to explore inheritance with their families. The home learning in this lesson should be focused on nonhuman examples of trait variation, although if students bring in human examples on their own, that is OK.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: A key element of the Anchoring Phenomenon routine is inviting students to share their experiences with related phenomena. Connecting the anchoring phenomenon more concretely to their world can help it be more personally meaningful to each student, supporting their engagement with it and increasing their investment in figuring out the broader question of how living things get variations in their traits.\\n \\n\\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n \\n9\\t� SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, artifacts or photos collected from self-documentation home learning (optional), chart paper, markers\\n\\nShare related phenomena examples. Display slide U. Invite students to share the examples they listed in their science notebook during the previous class and to show and tell about any photos or other artifacts and ideas they collected during the home learning. Accept all student responses, as long as they are related to differences among living things, and try to draw out a wide variety of related phenomena. Keep a public record (on chart paper or in digital form) of the related phenomena to revisit later in the unit. You may also have students add their classmates� ideas to their own list of related phenomena in their science notebook.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat other examples have you seen of living things that are basically similar but have a range of different variations in a characteristic or trait?\\n\\nIn your example, try to identify the trait and variations for us so we can practice using those words.\\n \\nMy dog looks very different from my neighbor�s dog, and both of them look very different from another dog we know down the block. One trait could be their types of fur--the variations are that my dog is super fluffy, my neighbor�s dog has tight-curly fur, and the other has flat, short fur.\\n\\nI thought about the trait of height in the flowers outside school, and the variations could be tall, medium, and short, but it�s a range--it�s not like every tall flower is the same exact height and every short flower is the same height either.\\n\\nWhen I have grapes at lunch, they�re all the same reddish color, but my friend likes green grapes, and I�ve seen really dark purple grapes at the grocery store. So those are three variations of the trait of color of grapes.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n10\\t� GENERATE INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t5 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\nSupporting emergent multilinguals: Asking questions in everyday language allows students to share their thinking or experiences even if they do not have the appropriate scientific vocabulary yet. This is helpful for emergent multilingual students because by not requiring scientific words at the onset you do not limit their participation in classroom discourse.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\t� CREATE OUR DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t17 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\nGather students in a Scientists Circle and direct them to bring their questions with them. Instruct students to share their questions, one by one, with the whole group. Explain to students how you will create the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tOther students raise their hand if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThat student selects the next student.\\n?\\tContinue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n?\\tIf the question doesn�t fit with any questions that are already on the board, students should create a new cluster.\\n\\nSample student questions are listed below under the categories that some classes have used: ?\\n?\\tDiet and routines\\n?\\tDid those big-muscled animals exercise or work out?\\n?\\tDo those big-muscled cattle eat special or different foods than typical cattle?\\n?\\tDid those big-muscled animals take steroids?\\n?\\tCan chemicals make animals �mutants� (like superheros)?\\n?\\tHow does having such big muscles affect those animals?\\n?\\tVariation\\n?\\tWhy don�t all cattle have big muscles?\\n?\\tHow often do cattle have these extra-big muscles?\\n?\\tDo these cattle give people better meat or milk?\\n?\\tHow did those tulips get so many different colors, patterns, and petal shapes?\\n?\\tWhy do animals of the same kind (like dogs or cattle or squirrels) look different?\\n?\\tWhat causes the variation in living things� shapes, sizes, and/or colors?\\n?\\tCan humans control the variations we�re seeing, like those muscles?\\n?\\tFamily\\n?\\tDid those animals� parents have extra-big muscles, too?\\n?\\tAre those cattle born with extra-big muscles?\\n?\\tHow can things like big muscles or height or hair color �run� in a family?\\n?\\tDo genes or DNA or chromosomes have something to do with those extra-big muscles or other variations?\\n?\\tWhy do some people inherit more or different traits than other members of their family?\\n \\nThe first priority during the formation of the DQB is reinforcing a classroom community wherein all ideas are valued. As such, everyone should have a question on the board. Use your judgement on how to press students to form �how� and �why� questions. If a student struggles with sharing, encourage him or her to go public with their question as it is rather than focusing specifically on forming a �how� or �why� question.\\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� CONSIDER IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATION\\t10 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, chart paper, markers\\n\\nGenerate ideas for investigation. Display slide X. Say, We have so many ideas to explore! How could we start to investigate the answers to some of these questions? Make a chart in your science notebook with the title �Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need�. Take a few minutes to write your thoughts about how we might be able to try to answer some of the questions we have on our Driving Question Board.\\n\\nHave students generate ideas in their science notebook individually for 2 minutes. Meanwhile, title chart paper with �Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need\".\\n\\nShare ideas for investigations. Display slide Y. Direct students to turn and talk with a neighbor to share one or two of their ideas. After a moment of partner talk, ask student pairs to share one idea with the whole class. As each pair contributes an idea, record it on the Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need chart for the whole class to keep as a reference. The goal is to hear a variety of ideas that we may be able to investigate over the course of the whole unit.\\n\\nSee the example Ideas for Future Investigations and Data We Need chart shown here.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLesson 1: How could penguins and other things living today be connected to the things that lived long ago?\\n\\n \\nPrevious Lesson  There is no previous lesson.\\n\\nThis Lesson\\n\\nAnchoring Phenomenon\\n\\n4 days\\n \\n\\n\\nWe record what we notice and wonder about the fossil of a giant penguin from long ago found in present-day Peru. We analyze data cards about penguins living today. We develop initial explanations of how these penguins could be connected. We brainstorm possible mechanisms to help explain two things: (1) Where did all the ancient penguins go? and (2) Where did all the different species of modern penguins come from? We brainstorm other related phenomena of organisms alive today that also might be connected to organisms that lived long ago. We develop a Driving Question Board to guide future investigations.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nClarkeLab\\n\\nNext Lesson  We will analyze data on a set of heritable body structures and behaviors in modern penguins to look for patterns and infer connections among them (and Pedro).

So, you will need to make accommodations so that students with visual disabilities can access these data.

Your students� IEP or 504 case leaders should also be able to provide you with specific resources and possible modifications to use.\\n \\nLesson 1 � Where We Are Going and NOT Going\\n\\nWhere We Are Going\\n\\nThis lesson elicits students� initial ideas about how living things of today could be connected to living things of the past. The word choice of connected is intentional, providing the broadest possible description to encourage students to propose and look for many possible patterns.\\n\\nOn days 1 and 2 of this unit, students use data cards to compare penguins of today to one another and to a fossil of a penguin from long ago. There is a lot of information on these cards, and therefore they are a relatively complex data set to work with. This will be a challenging data analysis task for students as they will be looking for patterns in the complex data set.\\n\\nHowever, students will be working with Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro again in Lesson 2 and a more complex version of the cards in Lesson 3. So it\\'s OK if students feel a bit overwhelmed with trying to look at all the cards at once during their first exposure to them in this lesson. There is guidance in the lesson for helping students work with a smaller number of cards at first, before looking for patterns across the entire set of data.\\n\\nOne pattern that will be particularly challenging for students to look for in this lesson will be the geographic distribution of different species of penguins. This is because the orientation of the maps used on the Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro have a Southern Hemisphere view of the globe. This view will likely be unfamiliar to students. Using the physical squishy globes to help orient students to this view of Earth will be helpful. Students will have some prior experience in the Storms Unit, the Everest Unit, the Tsunami Unit, and the Palm Oil Unit working with maps, and specifically ones that reference locations in the Southern Hemisphere where Lima, Peru, is located (a city relatively close to the fossil dig site of Pedro). The data card for Pedro includes a global map that shows the shifted location of the continents, mountain ranges, and sea levels for Earth at that time. In a previous unit, OpenSciEd Unit 6.4: What causes Earth�s surface to change? (Everest Unit), students built the idea that the continents were in different positions millions of years ago.\\n\\nWhere We Are NOT Going\\n\\nBy the end of the unit, students will be able to explain the relationships between organisms from long ago and organisms alive today in terms of how closely related they are via natural selection. This lesson, however, avoids introducing the words related or descended as possible connections between Pedro and modern penguins, although some students may introduce these words themselves. Here is the reasoning behind this choice. The word related has multiple meanings, including being related on a family tree such as the pedigrees students used in OpenSciEd Unit 8.5: Why are living things different from one another? (Muscles Unit). This meaning assumes an idea we want students to derive in the unit and converge on toward the end of the unit (but not now in Lesson 1)--that different species of organisms descend from a common ancestor at some point in the past.\\n\\nWhen the word descended is used to describe connections between things living today and things living long ago, it is assuming an idea we want students to derive in the unit--that a species alive today could have descended from a different species in the past. It precludes an idea that students may hold--that the organisms alive today are not different from their ancient ancestors. It will be productive for some students to wrestle on their own with competing ideas around this. In Lesson 6, they will converge on the idea that, for many organisms, the body structures found in a population of descendants appear to be changing over millions of generations.\\n\\nThis lesson refers to different species of penguins. The use of the word species in this context is referring to a more general definition. We acknowledge that the word species is used beginning in elementary (3rd grade): LS4.B: Natural Selection--Sometimes the differences in characteristics between individuals of the same species provide advantages in surviving, finding mates, and reproducing. We start deepening our understanding of species in Lesson 4, and it continues throughout the unit. This unit, however, does not develop the ideas behind speciation, which is an area of inquiry that is more productive to save for high school when it will be better aligned to the disciplinary core ideas in that grade band.\\n \\nThe unit does not name the mechanisms of natural selection until Lesson 9, which is after students derive them from case studies themselves first. Students may come into this unit with many partial understandings about natural selection. If such ideas come up during the unit, don�t be afraid to put them up on the initial model and explanation as ideas to consider with question marks. But don�t elevate any of these ideas yet. Remind students that we need to be able to defend our ideas with evidence, so the class can collect data and decide which ideas are best supported by evidence. Having norms in class around a growth mindset will help students know that it�s OK and very productive to change our mind about our ideas. That�s how we grow and learn.\\n \\nLEARNING PLAN for LESSON 1\\n1\\t� MEET PEDRO, A HUMAN-SIZED PENGUIN\\t17 min\\n\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: Reading the transcript of the podcast as they are listening to it provides students multiple representations (audio, photos, and text) of the information, which could be harder to interpret from audio alone.\\n \\nUsing a meterstick against a wall, measure approximately 5 feet (about 1.5 meters) up from the ground. Indicate this height on the wall using something like a 5�6-inch piece of painter�s tape, a sticky note, or masking tape at the 5-foot mark to show students how tall the penguin was. Ask, How does this compare with what you know about penguins living today? Students should suggest that this is much taller than penguins of today.\\n\\nForeground the purpose of examining an audio recording and photo journal. Project slide B and say, What is really cool is that we were able to get in touch with two members of the research team that found this penguin fossil to learn more about their discovery. And what is also really great is that they shared with us some of the photos they took of their work.\\n\\nDistribute Reference: Podcast Transcript and Photo Journal to students. Explain that while they listen to the recording students can follow along using the transcript and photos. Before playing the recording, tell students to annotate the transcript as they listen with any ideas that stand out to them as particularly interesting and any questions that they have. When they are finished, they can tape this document into their notebook.\\n\\n\\nListen to the recording of the story about Pedro�s discovery. Play https://youtu.be/p290JDDrBMA while students jot down notes on their copy of the transcript.?\\n\\nAfter listening to the recording, have a few students share some of the ideas that they found particularly interesting or exciting. Briefly recall what we know about fossils from the Everest Unit unit. Ask, What do you know from the Everest Unit unit about how a fossil would become exposed so a scientist like Se�or Altamirano could find it?\\n\\nSample student responses\\n?\\tWhen plates move and collide, land can get pushed up and expose fossils that were buried.\\n \\n?\\tWhen plates move apart, fossils that were buried could be exposed.\\n?\\tErosion from wind and rain can wear away the land and expose fossils.\\n?\\tSometimes both plates moving and erosion is what leads to fossils being exposed like the fossil at the top of Everest.\\n\\n \\nHOME LEARNING OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nConsider posting the podcast and transcript files on your classroom website or similar space for students who are interested in listening to it again outside of class and encourage them to share both the transcript and podcast with others in their family. Some students may find a variety of ways it is relevant to themselves and to others in their community, beyond the discovery of Pedro. Examples include the stories of what drew these people into their careers, international connections, a diverse group of scientists, and/or thinking about what the environment and things that lived in it were like in one�s own local area many millions of years ago.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\t� BRAINSTORM TYPES OF EVIDENCE NEEDED\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nMake note of the most likely connections listed on the poster. Say, It sounds like living things can be connected in a lot of different ways. Let�s think about the most likely ways that Pedro might be connected to the penguins alive on Earth today.\\n\\nAs students share their ideas, place an asterisk next to any of the connections that the class identifies as a �likely� type of connection between Pedro and penguins alive today. At this point, accept all student ideas.\\n\\n\\nLead a class discussion about the evidence needed to determine a connection. Say, It sounds like there might be some kind of connection between Pedro and the different kinds of penguins alive today, but we aren�t really sure how they might be connected, or even if they are connected!\\n\\nPut up the Evidence We Need poster and keep a running list of evidence we need. As students share their ideas, pay particularly close attention to any ideas related to learning more about modern penguins.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat kinds of data would you need to determine whether penguins alive today are connected to Pedro?\\n \\nWe would need to know where the modern penguins live.\\n\\nWe would need to know more about where Pedro and other kinds of penguins like Pedro used to live.\\n \\n \\n\\n3\\t� MEET THREE SPECIES OF PENGUINS ALIVE TODAY\\t15 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Penguin Comparison, transparent tape, only the emperor and Ad�lie and southern rockhopper cards from Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro, 1 Earth squish ball with countries labeled, 1 Earth squish ball with no labels, 2 paper hot-cup sleeves, emperor penguin video at https://youtu.be/prTEuLSCsJ4, rockhopper penguin video at https://youtu.be/XdW4gOq5kz8, Ad�lie penguin video at https://youtu.be/aPloAdoZsSM, 1 classroom globe (optional)\\n\\n \\nPrepare to meet three species of penguins alive today. Project slide D and say, Let�s get ready to document some of what we observe about the kinds of penguins alive today. Share that you have some videos and information cards about three different species of penguins alive today.\\n\\nDistribute a copy of Penguin Comparison to each student and have them tape it into their notebook. Tell students that the data table will help to organize our thinking about the three kinds of penguins we�re going to look at first. Orient students to the features of the table, pointing out the first column for listing the penguin species and the remaining columns of the table for adding details about specific physical traits and behaviors noticed for each penguin species.\\n\\nIntroduce the emperor penguin. Share that the first species of penguin we are going to observe is an emperor penguin. This is the first of three videos students will watch to make observations about the penguins. Show https://youtu.be/prTEuLSCsJ4 , also linked on slide E.\\n\\nThen project slide F, which shows the emperor penguin card. Arrange students into groups of three and provide each group with a copy of the emperor penguin card from Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nUniversal Design for Learning: To support students in map reading during this activity section, hold up a larger globe, if you have one, to orient students to the corresponding locations on their own globes. You may want to also point out where the North and South Poles are on the globe. Providing physical objects and spatial models to convey perspective can help support representation, according to the UDL framework.\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\n\\nOrient to locations on the globe.? Say, This penguin card and other penguin cards you will use include a map of where that species of penguin lives. This map is not a typical view of Earth you often see, as it is only showing the Southern Hemisphere. Let�s orient to that view a bit using some globes, which you can keep at your desk as you work with your group to help visualize where these locations are on Earth.\\n\\nDistribute both types of squish ball globes and 2 hot-cup sleeves to each trio. Hold up a squish ball globe (or larger globe) and instruct students to demonstrate the following with their own squish ball globes:\\n?\\tUsing the hot-cup sleeve as a base to keep the squish ball from rolling around, place each Earth squish ball on its own sleeve so that the northern pole is pointed to the ceiling.\\n?\\tAsk students to each point to where we live on both globes.\\n?\\tFind Peru.\\n?\\tLocate South America, the southern tip of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica.\\n?\\tFlip each Earth squish ball on the stand so that Antarctica is pointed toward the ceiling.\\n\\nSay, Looking downward on your globe from above gives you a view of the Southern Hemisphere. That is the view shown on the map on the data card, and this is the kind of map orientation you will see on other penguin data cards.\\n\\nRecord ideas from the emperor penguin data card. Students may wish to share their ideas with their group prior to adding to their data table. Give students a few minutes to examine the card information for the emperor penguin and add to their data table.\\n \\nIf time permits, consider asking students to share with their group their responses to the following questions: �Which of the penguins that we just observed was your favorite?\\nWhy?� This gives students more time to process the information they just heard and read about the three different species of penguins. It also gives students a safe space to begin going public with their ideas in this unit.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroduce the southern rockhopper penguin, followed by the Ad�lie penguin. Use the same process as for the emperor penguin. First, show https://youtu.be/XdW4gOq5kz8 on slide G. Then project the penguin card on slide H and distribute a southern rockhopper penguin card to each group. Next, show https://youtu.be/aPloAdoZsSM on slide I, then project the penguin card on slide J and distribute an Ad�lie penguin card to each group. Give students time after each penguin introduction to add to the data table information from the videos and Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro. Spend about 4 minutes with each species of penguin.?\\n\\n4\\t� CONSIDER CONNECTIONS AMONG PENGUINS\\t5 min\\n \\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Penguin Comparison, only the emperor and Ad�lie and southern rockhopper cards from Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro, 1 Earth squish ball with countries labeled, 1 Earth squish ball with no labels, 2 paper hot-cup sleeves, Types of Connections poster\\n\\nDiscuss how the three species of penguins we observed compare to one another and to Pedro. Project slide K and say, Remember the question that we started considering at first was how Pedro and other penguins that lived long ago might somehow be connected to the penguins alive today. Let�s revisit that question now.\\n\\nInstruct students to look back at the list on the Types of Connections poster for how living things could be connected to one another and the comparisons that they made among the penguins on Penguin Comparison. Give students time in their groups to discuss the questions on the slide. Then bring the class together for a whole-class discussion.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat claims can you now make about how the emperor, southern rockhopper, and Ad�lie penguins are connected to one another?\\n \\nThe penguins have similar features and eat similar food. All three penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nAll three penguins appear to be black and white. All three penguins lay eggs.\\nThe rockhopper and Ad�lie eggs are incubated by both parents, while the emperor egg is only incubated by the father.\\n\\nAll the penguins swim, but the emperor dives the deepest.\\n\\nThe Ad�lie and emperor penguins live in and around Antarctica. All three penguins eat fish, krill, crustaceans, and squid.\\nAll three penguins have similar predators--carnivorous birds, leopard seals, killer whales.\\n \\n\\n \\nWhat ideas do you have about how these three species of penguins might be connected to Pedro? What additional evidence would you need to support or refute that claim?\\n \\nThe three penguins or maybe just one or two of the species of penguins could be distant relatives of Pedro--like a great, great, great, great grandchild. We would probably need to compare their traits to support or refute this claim.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 1\\n \\n5\\t� PREDICT PATTERNS IN PENGUINS\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: 3� x 3� sticky notes (optional)\\n\\nReview the need for evidence. Remind students that they have already made some claims about the ways that the three species of penguins living today we looked at are connected to one another and how they might be connected to Pedro. Tell students that in addition to the three species of penguins they already explored, there are 15 other species of penguins for a total of 18 different species of penguins living today. Show slide L to prompt a Turn and Talk around these questions:\\n?\\tWhat patterns in connections do you expect to find among the penguins alive today?\\n?\\tHow might those patterns help us consider other possible connections between the penguins of today and Pedro?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPredict patterns in penguins. Invite students to share their thinking with the class about the questions on slide L.\\n\\nSuggested prompt\\tSample student response\\n\\n \\nWhat patterns in connections do you expect to find among the penguins alive today?\\n \\nThe penguins alive today are all likely good swimmers.\\n\\nThe penguins alive today probably all eat the same kinds of food and are eaten by the same kinds of predators.\\n \\n \\n\\n6\\t� LOOK FOR PATTERNS AMONG PENGUINS\\t20 min\\n\\n \\n?\\tnumber of eggs\\n?\\tdistribution on map\\n?\\tdiving depth\\n\\nInstruct students to work in their group and come up with several different ways to sort the cards. Suggest to students that each group member should take a turn deciding how to sort the Data Cards for Modern Penguins and Pedro. Also recommend that they set\\naside Pedro�s card at first, and begin working with only the 18 cards for penguins alive today. You may choose to have the groups each work together to sort all their cards in three different ways. Or, if the number of cards is overwhelming to students, instruct groups to divide the cards equally among group members and agree on one way to sort the cards (one category of grouping). Then have each group member sort their subset of cards according to that category. The group can then combine their sorted cards to look at all 18 penguins. As a group, they can then divide the cards again and use a different way to sort the penguins.\\n\\n\\n\\nShare groupings, observations, and new questions that surfaced. After students have had sufficient time to sort the cards, have several groups share what they noticed, how they sorted the cards, and any new questions that came up. As students share their ideas, take note of the groupings; consider writing the groupings on the board.\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEmphasize that we have already made some big progress in finding connections among these penguins just by looking for patterns in the different categories of data.\\n\\nExamine the pattern of distribution more closely using a map. Refer to any suggestion that came up regarding patterns related to geography and say, Patterns in geographic location can be tricky to visualize without a map. Let�s discuss that one further by referencing the map of the Southern Hemisphere that�s on our data cards and then let�s discuss again some of the patterns you noticed.\\n\\nProject the map on slide N and ask students about the patterns in distribution. At this point, accept all student ideas.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n7\\t� PREDICT WHERE OTHER PENGUIN FOSSILS COULD BE FOUND\\t3 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n8\\t� PREDICT PENGUINS FROM LONG AGO\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n\\n?

Why?\\n \\nNo, they all would have been like Pedro.\\n\\nNo, there were fewer species of penguins in the past than now.\\n\\nYes, there must have been all the species of penguins alive today in the past too.\\n\\nYes, there were many different kinds of dinosaurs, so there were probably different kinds of penguins.\\n\\nThere are different species living now, so doesn�t that mean there would have to have been different species living at some point in the past too?\\n \\n\\nMotivate capturing these competing ideas. Say, OK, we have some ideas about how penguins that lived long ago might have been similar to and different from the penguins of today. We also have differences in the claims we are making about whether there was more than one species of penguin at a certain point in the past. So, let�s take some time to\\n \\nrepresent our current thinking about the one or more different species of penguins living at different points in time.\\n\\nCreate a penguin timeline on chart paper. Refer to slide R. Position a blank piece of chart paper horizontally and title it �Penguin Timeline.� Draw and label a horizontal arrow as �time (years before present)� with a long gap in time between the �recent past� and the �past from very long ago�. Add labels for �50� and �100� years ago to the �recent past� section of the line. Say, This axis will represent the years before present. So 50 and 100 years ago are the more-recent past. This break in the line represents a jump back to millions of years ago. I will label a point on the far left side of the arrow as �36 million years ago�, which is when Pedro lived.\\n\\n\\nAsk students how many species of penguins are living today. They will say, �eighteen�. Say that you are going to represent each of these species with a dot, all stacked above the line on the far right side of the timeline, to emphasize that they are living today.\\n\\nAdd a dot labeled �Pedro� at 36 million years ago and an arrow with a question mark over it pointing forward in time. Suggest that this line shows that we don�t know how long ago the Inkayacu, which is Pedro�s species of penguin, lived on Earth, but we do know that at some point in the past they no longer were living on Earth because they aren�t alive today. Tell students that we will refer to this image as our initial consensus model of the Penguin Timeline.\\n\\nIntroduce a way to distinguish modern and ancient penguins. Say, We are talking about these penguins from long ago and penguins from today. When we are considering penguins from millions of years ago, let�s refer to any of those penguins as �ancient penguins�. When we are referring to penguins of today, let�s call those �modern penguins�.\\n\\nAdd labels to the Penguin Timeline model. Add a label of �ancient penguins� over the section of the timeline on the left. Add a label over the 18 dots that says �modern penguins�.?\\n\\nRevist the area(s) of uncertainty around other species of ancient penguins. Say, So what did we think about penguins alive millions of years ago? Do we know if there are any other species of penguins that lived when Pedro lived? Students will say, �No�. Suggest that we add a lot of question marks around Pedro�s dot to represent this.\\n\\nSay, So let�s think about this. Pedro was an ancient penguin. But what happened to the Pedro species of penguin? Where did they go? And if there were other species of ancient penguins besides Pedro, then where did they go? And let�s also consider the reverse. Today there are 18 different species of modern penguins. Where did these modern penguins come from?\\n\\nGive students a minute to think on their own about these questions and then say, Let�s pick up there next time and try to figure out how we can fill in some of this area where there is a big gap in our model and where we have all these question marks.\\n \\n \\n\\nEnd of day 2\\n\\n10\\t� NAVIGATION\\t5 min\\nMATERIALS: Penguin Timeline model\\n\\nTurn and talk to share initial ideas about where ancient penguins went and where the modern penguins came from. Point to the question marks around Pedro�s dot on the Penguin Timeline model that represent questions we had about how long Pedro�s species of penguin lived and if there were other species of penguins living before, at the same time as, and after he did.\\n\\nProject slide S and point out these main ideas that have been raised so far:\\n?\\tPedro is a species of ancient penguin that does not live on Earth today.\\n?\\tWe wondered if there were other species of ancient penguins that lived long ago.\\n?\\tThere are 18 different species of penguins that live on Earth today.\\n\\nEmphasize that at the end of the last class we had two questions that came up about the gap we have in our model as we started considering connections over time:\\n?\\tWhere did all the ancient penguins go?\\n?\\tWhere did all the different species of modern penguins come from?\\n\\nGive students several moments to turn and talk with a partner about these questions. At this point, students should just be sharing their initial ideas. Bring the class back together and select a few students to share their ideas. Accept all student ideas.\\n\\nSay, It sounds like these two questions--Where did all the ancient penguins go? and Where did all the modern penguins come from?--are helping us consider other ways that Pedro could be connected to the penguins alive today.\\n\\n\\n11\\t� WRITE AND COMPARE INITIAL EXPLANATIONS\\t16 min\\n\\n \\nWrite an initial explanation. Project slide T and distribute Initial Explanations to each student and have them\\t  tape it into their science notebook (so they can refer to it in future lessons as well as this one). Say, Let�s take some time to\\t\\tgather our\\ninitial ideas about the questions we just discussed.\\n\\nInstruct students to use the handout to develop an initial explanation in response to each of these questions: Where did all the ancient penguins go? Where did all the different species of modern penguins come from?\\n\\nPoint out that there are rows on the handout to list multiple claims. Say, We might wonder if there are several different things going on here. Make more than one claim to answer each question, and for each claim, identify a possible mechanism and the evidence that would be needed to either support or refute that claim.\\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.B Develop an initial explanation and identify evidence needed to determine what caused the observed changes in the existence, diversity, and disappearance of different kinds of penguins throughout history.\\n\\nWhile we are at the end of 8th grade and you can expect students to have practiced constructing explanations in prior units, this is a pre-assessment opportunity to establish a baseline understanding of students\\' use of this practice, and they will have several other opportunities throughout the unit to show growth in this practice and around these ideas as they investigate evidence and develop key ideas.\\n\\nWhat to look and listen for: (1) Students make more than one claim about what happened to the penguins from long ago and about where the modern penguins came from, (2) students support their claim by providing a possible mechanism, (3) students articulate evidence needed to either support or refute their claim.\\n\\nWhat to do: If students are struggling you can allow them to work with a partner and/or use the following prompts to push them in their thinking:\\n?\\tWhat evidence would you need to support your claim?\\n?\\tWhat evidence would you need to refute the claim?\\n?\\tHow might that piece of evidence support (or refute) your claim?\\n?\\tWhy would that evidence convince you? What other kinds of evidence might you need?\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n12\\t� HOLD AN INITIAL CLASS CONSENSUS DISCUSSION\\t13 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, Initial Explanations, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nBuild an initial class consensus explanation.? Project slide V and gather students in a Scientists Circle with their science notebooks and Initial Explanations. The task will be to build an initial class consensus explanation through discussion of the two subquestions: (1) Where did all the ancient penguins go? and (2) Where did all the different species of modern penguins come from?\\n\\nDuring the discussion, capture students� claims and possible mechanisms on chart papers titled with each subquestion for future reference. Consider making a T-chart under each question with �claims� on the left side and �mechanisms� on the right. Note areas of disagreement or uncertainty (or places we agree on but need to support with evidence) with question marks. You will record evidence that could support or refute these claims on day 4.?\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nSupporting emerging multilingual students: Remember to use the words that students use whenever possible. Allow and encourage students to speak using both\\ncontent-specific and everyday words and phrases when expressing their ideas. This helps students fully express themselves, allowing others to question, evaluate, and build off their ideas. Switching back and forth between different registers is especially important for emerging multilingual students because it helps them draw on their full range of meaning-making resources.\\n \\n \\n\\n13\\t� BRAINSTORM AND SHARE RELATED PHENOMENA\\t7 min\\n\\n\\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n \\nGenerating related phenomena is a key element of the anchoring phenomenon routine. Tapping into prior knowledge and experiences broadens students� thinking related to this phenomenon and helps to make the unit phenomenon become more personally meaningful to each student. It is OK at this point if students share related phenomena that are not all that related.\\n \\n \\n\\n14\\t� NAVIGATION\\t4 min\\n\\n\\nEnd of day 3\\n\\n15\\t� DEVELOP INITIAL QUESTIONS\\t8 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n16\\t� REVISE QUESTIONS\\t4 min\\nMATERIALS: science notebook, 2 3� x 3� sticky notes or index cards, 1 marker, chart paper, markers\\n\\n \\nPrepare to construct the Driving Question Board (DQB).? Reference the questions students jotted down in their notebooks. Say, We�ve brainstormed a lot of questions about Pedro, penguins alive today, other penguins from long ago, and other similar phenomena. Let�s post our questions to our Driving Question Board and begin thinking about how we�re going to investigate to figure out if Pedro could be connected to modern penguins and our two subquestions: (1) Where did all the ancient penguins go? and (2) Where did all the different species of modern penguins come from?\\n\\nDevelop two questions for the DQB. Project slide Z and instruct students to use the question starters on the slide to draft two questions to contribute to the class Driving Question Board. These questions can be ones they already brainstormed, perhaps revised\\nbased on the question starters, or they can be new questions. Ask students to write their questions in marker on sticky notes (or index cards), one per note. They should write their questions so they are big and bold�we want to be able to see the questions. Remind students that it is part of our mission to try to answer these questions.\\n\\nIf the posters from this lesson are not already visible near your DQB space, rehang them there while students are revising their questions. If needed, create a chart paper poster or title a board space for the Driving Question Board.\\n \\n? ATTENDING TO EQUITY\\n\\nA DQB provides a public representation of the class�s joint mission. Students can share their questions and wonderings with one another, and the visual representation offers another modality for students to access science in the classroom. It should be centrally located in the classroom so that it can be referenced and added to throughout the unit.\\n \\n\\n \\nASSESSMENT OPPORTUNITY\\n \\nBuilding towards: 1.C Ask questions that arise from initial observations of patterns in the images depicting anatomical similarities and differences of penguins that are alive today and of a fossil of a penguin from long ago.\\n\\nWhat to look and listen for\\n?\\tIt is important that all questions posed by students be placed on the DQB regardless of whether\\n \\n \\n\\n17\\t� BUILD THE DRIVING QUESTION BOARD\\t20 min\\nMATERIALS: questions on sticky notes, 3� x 3� sticky notes or index cards, markers\\n\\nShare questions to develop the Driving Question Board. Instruct students to bring their two sticky notes along with their science notebook and meet in a Scientists Circle around the DQB. Share slide AA and say, Now we�re ready to post our questions that will help us figure out if Pedro could be connected to modern penguins. We�re also working on figuring out our two subquestions: (1) Where did all the ancient penguins go? and (2) Where did all the different species of modern penguins come from?\\n\\nContinue, It is important that we hear everybody�s questions, and we might find that we have questions similar to some of our classmates� questions, and when that happens we will group them together. Our DQB will guide our investigations as we attempt to answer the question: How could things living today be connected to the things that lived long ago?\\n\\nInstruct students to share their questions, one by one, with the whole group. Explain to students how you will create the DQB:\\n?\\tThe first student reads his or her question aloud to the class, then posts it on the DQB.\\n?\\tStudents who are listening should raise their hand if they have a question that relates to the question that was just read aloud.\\n?\\tThe first student selects the next student whose hand is raised.\\n?\\tThe second student reads his or her question, says why or how it relates, and posts it near the question it most relates to on the DQB.\\n?\\tThat student selects the next student.\\n?\\tContinue until everyone has at least one question on the DQB.\\n \\n\\nIf the question is a new question and doesn�t fit with any questions that are already on the board, students should create a new cluster.\\n\\nLabel or title the clusters of questions. After all students have shared their questions, you will end up with a DQB that has several different clusters of questions. As a class, decide on �umbrella� questions or topics for the clusters of questions. Write these on sticky notes and place them on the DQB near their related cluster.\\n\\nHere are some examples of the kinds of questions students might come up with:\\n?\\tWhat other penguin fossils have been found?\\n?\\tWhere have other penguin fossils been found?\\n?\\tWhat were the traits or characteristics of penguins from long ago?\\n?\\tHow closely connected are penguins to other birds living today?\\n?\\tHow did Pedro end up in Peru while all the ones (penguins) now live in colder places?\\n?\\tWhy do most penguins live in Antarctica?\\n?\\tWill the penguins� food change (in the future)?\\n?\\tHow do organisms change over time?\\n?\\tWhat caused the differences in penguins?\\n?\\tWhat was the environment like back then?\\n?\\tHow did the location where Pedro was found look in the past?\\n?\\tDo all these differences help organisms to become better?\\n?\\tWere there other fossils like Pedro?\\n?\\tHow do scientists or artists determine what an ancient penguin looked like?\\n\\nPossible clusters might include the following:\\n?\\tModern penguins\\n?\\tAncient penguins\\n?\\tExtinction\\n?\\tConnection between modern and ancient penguins\\n?\\tHow do the changes happen?\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n18\\t� BRAINSTORM IDEAS FOR INVESTIGATIONS\\t10 min\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n19\\t� NAVIGATION\\t3 min\\n\\n \\n\\n \\nSUPPORTING STUDENTS IN MAKING CONNECTIONS IN ELA\\n \\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.RST.6-8.2: Determine the central ideas or conclusions of a text; provide an accurate summary of the text distinct from prior knowledge or opinions.\\n\\nOn day 1, students gather information from an audio recording and transcript about a giant penguin fossil that was discovered in the desert of Peru and use it to glean important insights about the traits of the penguin fossil that was discovered.\\n\\nCCSS.ELA-Literacy.SL.8.1.C: Pose questions that connect the ideas of several speakers and respond to others\\' questions and comments with relevant evidence, observations, and ideas.\\n\\nWhen the class is building the Driving Question Board, if a student forgets to explain why or how their question is linked to someone else�s question, press that student to try to talk through their own thinking. This is a key way to emphasize the importance of listening to and building off of one another�s ideas and to help scaffold student thinking.\\n\\nIf students can�t figure out which question to connect theirs to, encourage them to ask the class for help. After an idea is shared, ask the original presenter if there is agreement and why, and then post the question.\\n\\nThis lesson�s activities rely on students communicating and articulating their thinking. One tool that may support classroom discussion is the Communicating in Scientific Ways (CSW) sentence starters. To support discussion, reference the sentence starters on the CSW chart and encourage students to use those sentence starters to help them communicate. The sentence starters can be especially useful for helping students engage in scientific talk, particularly students who may feel reluctant to contribute.\\n'"
