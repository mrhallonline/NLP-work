Students develop systems models to communicate their ideas about important structural parts of the cup systems and mechanisms that can explain how and why the drink in the regular cup  warms up while the drink in the fancy cup stays a little colder. The purpose of the anchor is twofold. First, it is used to probe student understanding of how something warms up or cools down  and how an object’s structure could mediate this process. It leverages students’ related experiences of other objects that are designed to keep things cold or hot so that students begin to  identify similar structural components or processes that may be important for explaining the phenomenon.

What to do: Students do not need to know how to explain the system completely right now; rather, they are  demonstrating how they would model a new system and what they believe would be important to include.  They can note on their models what each part is doing to help the object work and where they are uncertain  about whether a part is important. If your students struggle with identifying important components of the new  systems of the related phenomena, add more instructional time to work on this aspect of modeling. To do  this, pick one of the related phenomena from the class list. Create a three-column chart with “Important parts”,  “Not important parts”, and “Not sure parts”. Have students work together to decide the important parts of the  system. Draw a sketch using these parts and the not sure parts but excluding the not important parts. The goal is  for students to get more comfortable with figuring out which parts of the system need to be included in the  model versus which parts are irrelevant.  \n",

            "● If a question is similar to (or the same as) another one, have the student place it on top of the question  that is similar so other students can visually see how many of the questions are the same or related.  Emphasize that this provides us with evidence of where many people are thinking about similar things. Here’s a secret - in Lesson 3, students will work with a similar timeline for the 1918 influenza pandemic. The  Lesson 1 and Lesson 3 timelines will both play a role later in the unit. In the next lesson, you will begin by sharing with students a few of their comments about the video and discuss  a general phenomenon of developing nations’ success relative to other countries in handling the COVID-19  pandemic. In the unit introduction and pre-writing, we reflected on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our lives and the lives of other people. MATERIALS: chart paper and sticky notes (or virtual replacement) MATERIALS: chart paper, two colors of sticky notes (or virtual replacement) MATERIALS: COVID-19 Data handout (or virtual replacement) MATERIALS: COVID-19 Timeline handout (or virtual replacement) MATERIALS: video(s), sticky notes or virtual replacement On this first full day of the unit, we discuss as a group the changes in our lives and the lives of other people. We  introduce the basic vocabulary of how we’ll refer to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 virus. We analyze data from  the COVID-19 pandemic around the world and then develop a timeline of what has happened in our area, the  country, and the world since the pandemic began. We add personal events to this timeline at home. We discuss  our timeline and realize one of the most important events is missing: how the pandemic ends. We develop a  Driving Question Board with our questions about the COVID-19 pandemic and how it will end. Our teacher  points out that this is not the first pandemic that has ever happened, and we watch a video about success in  addressing the pandemic in Africa that leaves us with thoughts and questions for Lesson 2. Orient students to the idea of making a timeline. Part Duration Summary Slide Materials \n",

            "Listen for questions that are open (how/why) versus closed (yes/no). As students are sharing questions, you can  ask them to rephrase questions into a how/why questions if they have experience doing this. It is better to have  more how and why questions on the Driving Question Board, but you don’t need all questions to be open  questions. Student responses will vary, but may include the following. Redirect students away from responses that are derogatory toward people in  other places or that assign blame to people in places where the pandemic happens to be bad at the moment or was particularly bad in the  past. This large amount of chart paper is recommended so students have a good deal of  space in which to make their class timeline. There is a virtual Google slide version of Part 5 available in the folder. This lesson is about putting students’ experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic in a context of others’ experiences and local, national, and global events, and then asking questions about where  the pandemic is going. Students will reflect on what has happened so far to both them and others. They will also gain an idea of how these experiences fit into a broader picture of events  outside their control - both pandemic-related events and events reflecting more societal changes/norms. We will examine different pandemics and epidemics throughout history to determine which might tell us the most about where the COVID-19 pandemic is going. We’ll post any new or confusing terms here so we can easily remember them.✱ You may wish to group students’ comments so you can talk about groups of comments, instead of specific ones,  in Lesson 2 and thereby include as many student ideas as possible. You may wish to use the Word Wall to not only remind students of important vocabulary from the unit, but  also help students remember connections between big ideas. This could be done on a poster by drawing lines  between words, in a digital setting by moving words around into groups or a web, or on a wall or cork board by  using string to connect related words.\n"

others?', '(Storms Unit) about how water cycles through the atmosphere.', 'In  that unit, students figured out that air particles near the ground get warmed up by the sun and that this energy  is transferred from the particles in the ground to the air through conduction.', 'The temperature of water or soil  increases as energy is added to them/the substance.', 'As more energy is added, some water molecules turn into  a gas and become water vapor (evaporation).', 'As water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and will turn  back into liquid.', 'It condenses on dust particles or other things in the air and begins to form clouds and  eventually falls as precipitation.', 'Students may also recall the role of wind in moving parcels of air around.', 'If  your students have not experienced the Storms Unit, you may need to spend additional time developing these  ideas with your students.', 'Additional Guidance \\n-A- It can be helpful to keep a  public record of the Table of  Contents on poster paper in the  room for students who might forget  to update their Table of Contents  and for students who have been  absent.', 'Additional Guidance \\n-B- There are two goals for this turn  and talk: (1) to prepare students to  think about why people may want  to raise chickens and (2) to help  students build confidence in  sharing their ideas publicly.', 'Additional Guidance \\n-E- It is possible that some  students might think of heartworm  as a possible cause already based  on past experience.', 'This should be  treated as any other prediction and  the following lessons aren’t  “spoiled” by an early suggestion of  heartworm.', 'Additional Guidance \\n-G- There are a lot of words that  may be unfamiliar to students in the  checkup sheet.', 'One way to support  students’ comprehension is to  prompt them to look up words they  don’t know and create their own  vocabulary list in their science  \\n Additional Guidance \\n-I- These index cards or images will  be useful for moving around on this  poster.', 'You will be able to space  these index cards out and add  photographs next to each of these  before forming the Driving  Question Board.', 'This will help  foreground that coming up with  questions about all sorts of  organisms that come from eggs is  fair game (and desirable) for the  Driving Question Board.', 'ADDITIONAL  GUIDANCE \\nIf you want to modify the anchor, keep the following questions in mind as you brainstorm ways to approach  the anchor scenario: \\n● Is it going to be meaningful for my students?', '● Is it going to motivate students to want to explain how things warm up, cool down, or maintain their  temperature over time in the given context?', '● Is it going to help students connect their observations of the cups to their experiences with related  phenomena and related systems?', 'An example modification: If reducing single-use plastic is an important issue for your students, set up the  anchor around avoiding non-recyclable straws.', 'Without a straw, the lid on the regular cup must be removed to  take a sip, but then the drink warms up more quickly, thus the need for a reusable cup and straw.', 'This version  of the anchor is well-connected to the content of the unit, and could be motivational to students.', 'ADDITIONAL  GUIDANCE \\nRefer to the cups as the regular cup and the fancy cup.', 'Avoid using the terms single-wall and double-wall  during today’s lesson.', 'Wait until your students have established that the regular cup has only 1 wall and the  fancy cup has 2 walls before describing the cups as single-wall and double-wall.', 'ALTERNATE  ACTIVITY \\nYou may wish to change the order of the stories that you show to connect to the situation that is more closely  connected to what your community has experienced.', 'For example, if your community has experienced  flooding, you may want to start with the Vicksburg, MS, story and then show the drought story.', 'If the story  order is changed, you will also need to change the Notice and Wonder titles on slides A, B, C, D, and F.  \\n Anchoring Phenomenon As students share, probe their thinking about what each part does in the system, focusing particularly on parts that they have identified as  slightly different between the two cup systems.', 'As students work, circulate around the classroom to make sure they are not just sketching the  cups but are explaining parts of the cups that help/do not help keep the drink cold.', 'Attending to Equity \\n-L- The central goal during the  formation of the DQB is reinforcing a  classroom community where all ideas  are valued and everyone has a  question up on the board.', 'Use your judgement on how to press  students to form how and why  \\n build a sense of pride in their work.', 'You may want to inform students that professional scientists collaborate with  one another to brainstorm, discuss, and review their work also.', 'but keep in mind we will not return to these questions until later in the unit (Lessons 8 and 15).', 'Classroom Artifact \\n-D- Sample driving question board  layout positioned at the front of the  classroom for two sections (left and  right side).', 'This is a permanent  board but could also be placed on  butcher paper or sticky sheets for  mobility when multiple class  sections are engaging with the unit.', '(Click image below to see a larger  version.)', 'Develop an initial model to describe the phenomena and  mechanisms that cause one chicken egg to hatch and another not  to hatch (effect), showing structures and mechanisms, both  observable and unobservable, inside the egg (system) and in the  environment outside the egg (system).', 'Ask questions that can be investigated in the scope of the  classroom that arise from careful

models as  systems models, identifying the important  parts of each system and how those parts  work together to keep a drink cold.', 'On day 2  of this lesson, students will think about what  is happening inside the cup systems and  with the cups’ structural parts as the drink  warms up.', 'development of embryos.', 'This occurs in Lesson 4.', 'A simple model for cell reproduction  (mitosis lite) is developed later in this unit (after lesson 9) to account for how a single cell  can develop into many, forming bigger and bigger tissues and organs in the embryo over  time.', 'In addition, the idea that when cells form new cells they first produce additional cell  parts.', 'This is a simplified introduction to mitosis (a target idea for high school).', 'In addition,  the idea that newly-formed cells can form new shapes and structures is introduced.', 'This is a  simplified introduction to the idea that cells differentiate, but no attempt to explain what  causes the differentiation or how it is done in this unit.', 'The fuller exploration of differentiation  is saved for high school.', 'The unit introduces the difference between sexual and asexual reproduction, and the role of  sex cells in contributing half of some key parts (chromosomes) that a cell needs in order to  start producing more cells for this type of organism.', 'The unit does not explore meiosis, nor  use genetic information to produce new substances.', 'An opportunity to connect concepts  related to cells performing chemical reactions using food molecules as a reactant to  produce new substances is an optional extension/connection provided in the unit.', 'Display slide E. Prompt students to make similar sketches in their science notebook, now  turning the sketches into models that try to explain why the drink in the regular cup warms  up over time and if/how the fancy cup could slow the warming process.', 'Remind students of  the words system and model that they added to their word walls in the One-way Mirror Unit  Models should \\n● try to explain what is happening that leads the drink inside to warm up or not warm  up as fast and \\n● use symbols, color, and words to help communicate these ideas.', 'Don’t worry if some questions are raised that do not lead to productive investigations.', 'Over time students will  get better and better at forming testable questions in the scope of the driving question.', 'This type of activity  gives them practice at doing that.', 'During this modeling moment, it is important to honor  students’ ideas and create a model that reflects their thinking versus making an exact copy of the model shown here.', 'An example of this first  part of the initial consensus model can be found below.', 'This is just one example of the model, and it could potentially have different areas of  agreement and disagreement.', 'It’s important to follow your students’ ideas during this discussion and not feel strongly tied to replicating this  exact model.', 'Emphasize to students that they will use  models for explaining why and how  phenomena occur as they do.', 'To be useful,  models need to be “applied” to explain  something, and models are most helpful  when they can help us explain a lot of similar  phenomena.', 'Because students have  developed only their initial models so far,  they may not be able to explain a lot of the  anchor phenomenon with confidence, and  that is OK. Models are supposed to change  as our knowledge grows, therefore students  will continue to revise and edit their model  over the course of the unit.', '✱ STRATEGIES FOR THIS  CONSENSUS DISCUSSION \\nThere are two goals of this discussion: (1) to  continue to help students build the habit of  sharing their ideas publicly and (2) to  generate a variety of ideas about what is  going on with the regular cup and the fancy  cup that students agree with, disagree with,  or are uncertain about.', 'It is important to  accept all student responses and to  encourage students to share their ideas.', 'Highlight areas of disagreement and help  students clearly explicate their thinking in  these areas.', 'Be careful not to favorably  respond to any one idea over others so as  not to “give away” what is actually going on  in each cup system  \\n Encourage students to expand on why people raise chickens.', 'In this video montage, chickens are seen hatching  under a hen or in an incubator.', 'They are seen being fed and eggs are seen being collected.', 'The purpose of this  montage is to provide students with some more observations of why chickens are raised and the environments  they are raised in.', 'This will lead to students thinking about and wondering what chickens need to live and what  eggs need to hatch.', 'Establishing norms is an important focus early in the school year.', 'The brief reminder about norms that  happens in this moment assumes that your classroom norms have already been established in a previous unit.', 'Formative Assessment \\nAs students share and organize their  questions, listen for students to  contribute questions about what  causes an egg to hatch or not to hatch.', 'Listen for questions about the  environment inside and outside of the  egg.', 'Formative Assessment \\nInformal Assessment: \\nThis activity not only helps students  keep track of where they are in  their learning, but also helps the  teacher understand how much the  students gleaned from the lesson.', 'In the future, students will track  their progress with formal progress  trackers.', 'This activity is an informal  regrouping of what students  gleaned from lesson 1.', \"Formative Assessment \\nStudents' initial models should  never be used as an artifact for  grading, but it is very valuable as a  formative assessment to gain  insight into what students already  know about the phenomenon  being investigated.\", 'heir thinking in these areas.', 'Be  careful not to favorably respond to  any one idea over others so as not  to “give away” what might cause an  egg to hatch or not.', 'In selecting which approach to use, consider the following questions which can help you determine which  approach is best for your situation: \\n● Do you want students to participate in co-constructing the norms?', '● Do you want the same set of norms for every section of science you teach?', '● Do you want to work with your team teachers to establish a shared set of norms for students across all  their classes?', '● What kinds of consequences will you enforce if students do not follow the norms?', 'It can be helpful to keep a \\npublic record of the Table of \\nContents on poster paper in the \\nroom for students who might forget \\nto update their Table of Contents \\nand for students who have been \\nabsent.', 'It is important to involve students in  deciding the kinds of evidence that need to  be collected to support or refute a claim  (“What do we need to know?”) and in  defining the strategies and/or methods used  for collecting observations or data (“How will It is recommended to  have students do the following: \\n● Reserve a blank page at the start of the unit, to be titled on day 3 of this lesson when students are  given the unit question.', '● After the title page, reserve 2 pages (4 pages front-to-back) for the table of contents (unless all  tables of contents are at the front of the notebook).', '● Reserve 10 pages (20 pages front-to-back) for the Progress Tracker pages.', '● Number the pages so everyone begins the first investigation of the unit on the same page number.', 'It is useful to develop a public record that shows areas of agreement and disagreement in a shared class model.', 'Set up that model by building a poster that is similar to the template the students created in their journal.', 'Most  groups of students will only agree on two things in this model: a) both cases start with an egg, and b) one case  results in a baby chick and the other case results in an egg for food.', 'This will help the class converge on areas of  agreement and uncertainty and help foreground systems of thinking in the work for future lessons journals.']\n",
